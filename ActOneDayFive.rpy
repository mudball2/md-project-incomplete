  label firstClassDayFive:
    #Here Wyatt continues the story of his time with the Cartwrights, but this is many years after the death of his father. I didn't get confirmation on his actual age, but I'm going to assume 18. In this segment will make the character the same age just before or just right after he graduated High School. We'll adjust as needed. 

    w "[[Commuting to my class on the fifth day made me realize just how used to Praesentia I was becoming. My morning routine was settled and so was my path on which I commuted. It was amazing how natural everything had become in only a short time.]"

    w "[[However I was however troubled, and as a result had very little sleep at all last night.]"

    w "[[This whole thing with Moriya was keeping me thinking, ever since he showed up it seemed my hope for a peaceful passing in Praesentia was destroyed right before me. Now there was this thing with the feud he wanted to start.]"

    w "[[Although the word 'start' would be a poor choice of words. He would simply be escalating an already existing feud.]"

    w "[[I wasn't exactly sure where it would all lead, and it was just that that had me thinking up unitl I approached the door of Dr Shimazu's class.]"

    w "[[When I walked in it was just as I left it. Dr Shimazu was reading a new book, and the notebook I was writing in yesterday was on the exact same desk too.]"

    w "Same thing? "

    sh "Same thing. "

    w "[[I sat down at the usual desk and pulled out a pen. From there I wrote about something fairly recent.]"

    w "..."

    w "... ..."

    w "... ... ..."

    w "[[After Alyssa had chased away the guys that use to bully me all those years back, she would still accompany me every weekend to the Cartwright manor so I could fulfill my duties.]"

    w "[[I had heard stories of bears and mountain lions all my life, it made sense when you consider the environment I lived in, but I had never actually witnessed them in all my time living here.]"

    w "[[So to say the least, I was especially astonished when an attack happened to me the very first time. What was even more surprising was a peculiar discovery that was made the same day.]"

    w "[[It was like any other day walking from my old cabin to the manor, but while Alyssa and I joked about some character from a book, a bear made it's presence known and she wasn't particularly happy with us for whatever reason.]"

    w "[[Alyssa dashed off into the woods.]"

    w "Wait!!!"

    w "[[It was too late, at this point it was better to just go along so I chased after Alyssa.]"

    w "[[I guess most people would panic at the sight of a bear five feet in front of you instead of doing what they know to do in such a situation.]"

    w "[[When I dashed towards Alyssa I saw that she was climbing a tree, unfortunately that was the only one capable of climbing and she wasn't high enough yet.]"

    w "[[I ran towards the tree trying to help her up, but she was not making a lot of progress, I turned around to face an angry bear standing over me and getting ready to strike me.]"

    w "[[I put my hands in front of my face and screamed, I heard Alyssa do the same.]"

    w "Aaahh!!!"

    #Lolz, I'm so bad at this. Also if we could get ahold of some bear noises it would be great here. 

    w "[[I never heard or felt the bear strike though, just the sounds of a large odject hitting the ground.]"

    #A sound effect would be cool here too.  I'm saying this stuff to make up for my bad writing. 

    w "[[I lowered my hands and looked again at the scene.]"

    w "[[The bear was leaning on a tree twenty meters away, and it looked hurt.]"

    w "[[Alyssa and I were panting. It was clear that both of us were in shock concerning the new development before us.]"

    al "What did you do? "

    w "...That wasn't you? "

    w "[[The bear now injured limped away from the scene with all signs of aggression gone.]"

    w "[[I felt light headed suddenly and passed out.]"

    #Effect, darkness encloses scene to simulate passing out.

    w "..."

    w "[[I awoke in a guest bedroom at the Cartwright Manor.]"

    w "Ugh..."

    w "[[My head hurt.]"

    mrcar "It seems genetics have chosen you as well, Wyatt. Your dad had some magical affinity, but not nearly enough to stop an aggressing bear with no hands."

    w "[[Alyssa, who was also in the room, let out a deep sigh of relief.]"

    al "Just consider yourself lucky."

    mrcar "You were both lucky! The woods are not to be treaded lightly and both of you were careless."

    mrcar "Still, you put my daughter's safety first Wyatt, and for that I thank you. Get some rest. Magic can prove tiring. "

    w "[[With that Master Cartwright left the room, and Alyssa shot Wyatt a sly grin.]"

    al "So how long have you been holding that one in? And here I thought I was taking these walks every weekend to look after you. "

    w "It came out of nowhere honestly. "

    al "Really? Seemed pretty powerful for something that happened only once. "

    w "Are you suggesting that I've been secretly practicing magic without anyone noticing? "

    al "I'm suggesting it wouldn't be the first thing you do in secret that you've tried to hide from me. "

    #Can I get a blush from Wyatt here!? I feel like a director.

    w "H-How come you get to keep secrets then? "

    al "A cat doesn't concern itself with the matters of its master. "

    w "I've always been more of a dog person. "

    w "[[We both laughed.]"

    al "...but seriously. Did you know about this? "

    w "It's the first time, I swear. I'm not even sure I can repeat it."

    w "[[Alyssa narrowed her eyes to examine me thoroughly, as if she was trying to pry the answers straight out of my head.]"

    w "[[Her look became more at ease after some time.]"

    al "I believe you, but be more excited, you can use a magic. You might as well be treated like a god now. "

    w "Sounds like a scary thought actually. "

    al "It's not so bad. My dad was right though, you should get some sleep you look tired. "

    w "[[She made her way to the door.]"

    al "And if you masturbate you're cleaning the sheets."

    w "[[The door closed.]"

    w "{i}Damn that woman{/i}"

    w "{i}Great! I'm disrespecting her now.{/i}"

    w "[[I didn't feel all that tired really, but the time allotted for me to go to sleep proved otherwise.]"

    w "..."

    w "[[The bear attack was during my last couple weeks of high school, and rumors of someone with my blood taking down a bear with magic were circulating like crazy.]"

    w "[[I was in the school library which probably seemed small in comparision to some of the schools around more populated areas.]"

    er "Taking on a bear, eh? I find it hard to believe coming from someone who fought like a worm so many years ago. "

    w "It wouldn't have been wise to raise my hand against you. "

    er "You're right it wouldn't have been, but what about now? Have things changed? "

    w "[[He approached aggressively, which was an odd sight at first, I hadn't seen him make a move like this since we were young. Not expecting it I backed quickly into the bookshelf and a few came crashing down.]"

    w "[[The noise earned us the displeased looks of the librarian and the students in the room.]"

    er "That's unfortunate, you should pick those up. "

    w "[[I nodded and proceeded to do so.]"

    al "Unfortunate indeed. I do hope you're playing nice. "

    er "Of course, it was just an accident my Lady. Wyatt here was just being careless is all."

    al "He does have a knack for that, so long as you remember a deal we had. "

    er "Of course my Lady, you like taking good care of your pets. I didn't put a finger on him. "

    al "Leave."

    er "As you wish."

    w "[[Eric left and I finished putting the books away.]"

    al "Did he hurt you? "

    w "No. You're late. "

    al "I'm on time, you're early. "

    w "Sigh...I guess I am. "

    w "Are you ready at least? "

    al "Of course. "

    w "[[The both of us found a study table and got to work.]"

    w "..."

    w "[[Graduation had passed and so did the coming of the new year. I had grown very accustomed to making my usual weekend commute everyday and was fine with living out my days happily serving the Cartwright family like many generations did before me.]"

    w "[[Alyssa had started going to a local institution of higher education and I just continued to do my part for the Cartwrights.]"

    w "[[Since I was no longer in school now it became a daily thing making the commute and serving the Cartwright household.]"

    w "[[By now I was already the go to man for organizing household events and I was in charge of making sure that I managed the plebes well enough to make it all happen, but one day things changed.]"

    w "[[When I arrived at the Cartwright Manor the atmosphere was off and looked as if many of the occupants were stressed.]"

    al "Wyatt!"

    w "What's going on? "

    al "I don't know, but a Hito knocked on our door early this morning about thirty minutes before you arrived. My dad told me to get you."

    w "Do I have business with the Hitos? "

    al "I'm not sure, getting you to the dining room is all I know. "

    w "At least that explains all the servants being a little tense. "

    w "[[A quick nod from Alyssa noted that she agreed with me.]"

    al "It's not often a Hito makes his way out this far, especially to visit a family like mine. "

    al "Come on Wyatt. I'm not sure why my dad wants you with him, but it'd be best not to keep a Hito waiting. "

    w "[[Without further conversation we both made our way to the dining room and we were both on point taking a huge breath before opening the doors.]"

    w "How may I be of assistance Master Cartwright. "

    mrcar "I'm glad you can join us Wyatt. Please, take a seat. "

    mrcar "Alyssa please leave the room."

    w "[[It would be hard to notice Alyssa's look of panic if you had not known her as long as me and her father had.]"

    al "What's going on daddy? "

    mrcar "Please leave Alyssa. "

    w "[[Without further inquiry Alyssa left the room glancing back every now and then while closing the door quietly.]"

    mrcar "Mister Wyatt Armstrong, he's the one you inquired about. Mister Armstrong, this is his holiness Dr Koshiba. "

    ko "It is good to see you Wyatt. "

    w "[[His accent was strange.]"

    ko "I come here as a representative of Praesentia Academy and it is to my understanding that you have recently come to discover a magical affinity of yours lately."

    w "That is correct. "

    ko "Very good I am a researcher of sorts and have come to ask a series of questions and also put you through a number of very simple tests, I hope that you will cooperate."

    w "Of course. "

    w "[[For the next couple of hours he asked me questions about the past and about the time I had fought off the bear with this so called magic. After all of that he placed a pencil in front of me.]"

    ko "If you wouldn't mind, I would like you to try your best at moving this for me. Without any hands of course. "

    w "{i}Move it?{/i}"

    w "[[To my surprise even 'til this day, that was all it took. The pencil rolled back to Dr Koshiba and he caught it as it flew off the end of the table. He seemed amazed which contrasted greatly to Mr Cartwright's unamused grin.]"

    ko "..."

    ko "I have seen enough for today, if you gentlemen would not mind I would like to make a private phonecall. I would be happy if you could clear the room."

    w "[[He pulled a cellphone from his pocket.]"

    mrcar "Of course, we will be right outside. "

    w "[[Master Cartwright and I exited the room and found Alyssa not to far away from the door walking towards us.]"

    w "What was that all about? "

    mrcar "I don't know. It goes without saying that he has a great deal of interest in you though. "

    al "What was he doing? "

    w "Asking very strange questions."

    al "Like what? "

    w "Have I ever heard voices? "

    mrcar "Asking if he was familiar with certain stories of World History."

    w "And if I ever had a sexual relationship."

    mrcar "Yeah...that one was awkward. "

    al "Have you!?"

    w "[[Dr Koshiba oppened the door just then.]"

    ko "Lord Cartwright, I ask that you give Mr Armstrong until tomorrow morning to pack up his belongings so that I may take him back East so that I may monitor him more closely.]"

    w "[[There he will be attending Praesentia Academy for the next four years, or longer should he choose to.]"

    ko "He is still your vassal by Hito Law, but we are not taking him from you it will be a temporary relocation until we can have this sorted out. "

    mrcar "Who do you mean by {i}we{/i}? "

    ko "His High Holiness and myself. "

    mrcar "Then you leave me with no choice. Will you guarantee my vassal's safety at that institute? "

    ko "I will do what's within my power. "

    w "[[The rest was like a dream. All of a sudden I was being taken away from everything I ever knew and going to a place that I didn't really belong.]"

    w "[[I had to say goodbye to my mother, and to the Cartwright's who have always treated me like family.]"

    w "[[I wish I could recall everything that happened until the next morning when I left, but it was so quick for me that all I see is images.]"

    w "[[The only sounds I hear with them is the sound of Alyssa crying as I hugged her goodbye. Her, my mother and her father were all concerned for my safety. After attending Praesentia for four days, I'm concerned too.]"

    w "..."

    w "... ..."

    w "... ... ..."

    w "[[I looked at my Asla for the time. Five more minutes of class. I put my pen back in my pocket and sat idly for a little while.]"

    sh "Finished with your masterpiece Mr Armstrong?"

    w "[[Dr Shimazu closed his book and looked me in the eye.]"

    sh "Very well, class dismissed. Do take care of yourself tonight Mr Armstrong, and be ready to use that firearm should you have to."

    w "[[It was my turn to look Dr Shimazu in the eye.]"

    w "What's going on tonight? "

    sh "What indeed. Good-bye Mr Armstrong. "

    w "[[I got up and departed from the class. I was to get lunch and meet Moriya and his gang in the Admin building today. We are to finally hear more details about this plan of instigating a feud.]"

    w "[[With all the warnings before me, I could see that whatever he had in mind wasn't going to be good.]"

    #This is a more elaborate version of Moriya's crazy plan to lay waste to everything. I hope I do well in presenting it. Of course, I've not done well in anything concerning this story. 

    w "[[This hot dog isn't that bad...]"

    w "[[And neither was the atmosphere in the Admin building's clubroom that I was currently in.]"

    w "[[By the time of my arrival William and Yvonne were already in one of their lively debates that never seemed to have a definite topic and Mitsuyo was chowing down on something she called Chicken Yakisoba. I've never heard of it until today.]"

    w "[[Moriya was quietly staring out the window while leaning on the nearby bookshelf, but I couldn't be sure if he was patiently waiting for everyone to finish their meals or actually in deep thought.]"

    w "[[I looked at the chess board that was still laid out on the table with a single white pawn moved up two, and that was all.]"

    w "[[When everyone was close to finished Moriya walked up to the table and took a seat at its head. We quieted down.]"

    m "The plan is going to happen tonight at an hour before midnight. Mitsuyo and I have thoroughly made sure that the victims will be exactly where I tell you to be tonight. "

    m "There will be two teams, A and B. To make it simple we'll split it up as ladies and gentlemen. Team A will acquire a Hackett and Team B will incapacitate a Heidler. So Team A is ladies and Team B will be gentlemen. This will prevent difficulties."

    m "Once that is completed Team B will remain stationary and guard the Heidler while I transport the ladies and their victim to them. From there Mitsuyo and her underlings will handle the rest."

    m "Do you understand Bill? "

    wi "Why are you only asking me?"

    y "Where do you need us to be? "

    m "Team A is to wait outside the Aerospace department for the Hackett by the name of Alexander Kelly."

    w "[[During this time Moriya fiddled with his Asla for a second.]"

    m "This is his school profile and it includes an image. As for Team B, Hans Fuerst is the target. "

    w "[[He fiddles with his Asla again.]"

    m "And this is his information. "

    w "[[My Asla beeped and displayed an image of a young man that wore a pair of round glasses and wavy hair. He seemed intelligent and like a good guy, but I still couldn't really come to appreciate a Heidler naturally. It was them that killed my father afterall.]"

    w "[[Still, I couldn't help but feel like a hitman right now.]"
 
    m "Hans will be exiting the Engineering Library around eleven o'clock as well. I suggest waiting by the East entrance. "

    m "We'll all meet up here at the front entrance around nine."

    m "Mitsuyo; the Hackett gets there unharmed. Bill; kill the Heidler if you have to, but I don't want Wyatt's hands to get dirty."

    w "[[Kill him!?]"

    m "That will be all, dismissed."

    w "[[Everyone else didn't hesitate to leave, but I sat frozen for a while. By the time everyone had left Moriya asked me,]"

    m "Do you have a question Wyatt? "

    w "..."

    w "I-...Kill him? "

    m "With any luck it won't be you having to do it. Besides that shouldn't be a problem for you if it is a Heidler. You will do it for me, won't you?"

    w "..."

    w "[[He got very close to me.]"

    #After re-reading this and seeing its flaws, I cam to the conclusion that a crazed look from Moriya will help the scene seem more...real. I'm thinking like Higurashi crazy.

    m "While you think about your answer, remember who I am. I just got three people who are willing to kill themselves without questioning me to kill this Heidler, and I can get the entire school to get together to kill this Heidler as well if I just say the word."

    m "So remember who I am. You will do it for me should you have to, right Wyatt? "

    w "[[Would I? I didn't really have time to think about it.]"

    w "Yes, Your Holiness. "

    w "[[He whispered.]"

    m "That's a good man, and call me Moriya. "

    w "[[Afterwards he got up and moved a black pawn into the white pawn's killing zone.]"

    w "If the idea is just to create a feud, then why go this far though. "

    m "Contrary to what it seems, Hackett-Heidler relations are better than they have ever been, they actually talk to sort out their problems. A death on either side will break the truce in both the school and the world. "

    m "I just recently gained authority to handle the Hackett-Heidler relations within the school, I am the new Judge, jury, and I can hire any executioner I want. "

    m "Even if things start getting out of hand here, The pride of their parents will make sure that they stay here in Praesentia. I will be managing the chaos of a closed-circle feud within the school."

    m "Doesn't that sound comforting at least? That I will be mananging the chaos? I am god afterall. If not the whole world yet, then the school for now. "

    w "[[He's definitely mad.]"

    w "[[I wanted to get out of here alive too.]"

    w "So, nine o'clock tonight? "

    m "Nine o'clock. "

    w "[[I tried not to make it look like I was running out of the clubroom. Halfway to the bottom of the building I touched my sidearm. If Heidlers and Hacketts broke out the feud here in the school, then I'd definitely be needing it.]"

    #Well instead of thinking too long about how to start this off, I think I'm just going to jump right in there and whip it out.

    w "[[Most of the school day passed by in a blur, and I met up with the gang at nine just like I was asked. From there we all made our way to our respective destinations.]"

    w "[[It was late and pass my usual bedtime.]"

    w "Yawn!"

    wi "When you have someone like Moriya in your company, it's good to try and get used to the unexpected. "

    w "Yeah, I'm beginning to learn that. "

    w "[[A short silence overtook us before I asked a question.]"

    w "Would you call yourself a friend of Moriya's?"

    w "[[I wasn't sure why I was asking, just that it didn't seem like anyone was particularly close to the man.]"

    wi "No. "

    wi "No. Yvonne and I have ulterior motives, and Mitsuyo has been on Moriya's leash since the death of his last true friend. "

    w "You mean Moriya had an actual friend? "

    w "[[If these guys were just doing it for power, it was hard to believe that there would be someone as demonic as Moriya around.]"

    wi "Yep. They did everything you would expect best friends to do. Hell they even laughed together, and I haven't seen a genuine smile on Moriya's face since you came around. "

    w "How did he die? "

    wi "Moriya killed him. "

    wi "I was more or less aound when the fiasco happended. I have been lucky enough to spend a number of years on the East continent with the Hitos. It was a very interesting ordeal. "

    w "Why would he kill his best friend?"

    wi "From what I heard it was because of Mitsuyo. When I tried asking her about it when I first came into the group I thought she was going to scream my body apart. Scary things those sound workers."

    w "Did Mitsuyo not like Moriya's friend or something? "

    wi "Quite the opposite; Mitsuyo loved Moriya's friend. You see Mitsuyo and Moriya are probably the closest thing you'll call a friendship, but it doesn't really count seeing how they're family. "

    wi "They were like a trio of friends then I suppose, but when Moriya saw his friend and Mitsuyo getting close he did a lot of things to try and keep them apart. His efforts were in vain though. "

    wi "One day Moriya saw Mitsuyo and him fucking, and I guess that's what he was trying to avoid. Moriya used his magic to somehow rip the poor guy's heart out. He was enraged, or so the story goes, while Mitsuyo cired over the dead body. "

    wi "Of course I wasn't there to experience all that but the news got into great detail and tried to justify the actions of Moriya, saying it was never good to go over the heads of the gods and that Moriya was merciful towards Mitsuyo. "

    wi "Truth is, he could have easily killed Mitsuyo instead, or both. "

    w "[[All of a sudden my little cabin home on the lands of the Cartwrights seemed so much more precious.]"

    w "[[With all the wars that the Heidlers and Hacketts get in, we both had very civilized social structures and morals. With so much dying many begin to understand the importance of an individual's life.]"

    w "[[But the Hitos have never known. Is this what peace brings?]"

    w "[[All of a sudden it seemd relevant the conversation I had with Moriya and Mitsuyo about war and peace a couple days ago.]"

    w "[[And an even more relevant one yesterday when Moriya asked me if I liked Mitsuyo.]"

    wi "Moral of the story is do as you're told and don't fucking ask questions. "

    w "Yeah, I get it. "

    wi "Also, don't sleep with Mitsuyo. Hahaha!"

    w "I'll try to restrain myself. If I haven't made it known then let me say it: I don't want to die. "

    wi "Neither do I mate, but if I could, I would. You know what I'm saying?"

    w "[[Makes sense, Mitsuyo wasn't a bad looking woman.]"
