    #Well...I still feel that the mood of the story has been changing quite frequently as I move along, but I think I'm going to start keeping the mood pretty consistent from here out after the composition of that last text file. Of course the times deaths occur will bring a new mood, but aside from that I think the basic one will be discovery as mysteries unravel or something. I don't really know, I've been experimenting from the start. 

    #NEW NOTE: I re-read this piece and was extremely displeased. Please provide revision, or at the very least tell me it's not as bad as I think. 

    w "[[Wake up, hygiene, dress, train, school; it was all coming together finally. The only difference between today and the last two days was the addition of checking my email before doing anything.]"

    w "[[It would seem that the ASLA would be a very important part of my life because I wasn't necessarily eager to repeat yesterday's events.  As it turned out the Asla provided information about changes taking place in the school.]"

    w "[[More importatly however was the fact that instructors would assign homework via the Asla without any prior notice in class. So it would seem that this habit of checking my email will be helpful during my time here.]"

    w "[[Another change was the fact that I was actually up early today and was on the commuter train at an earlier hour than usual heading for the campus.]"

    w "[[Because of that I had thirty minutes to spare by the time I approached the door of my first class.]"

    w "[[Although it seemed unlikely I had convinced myself that answers were necessary today and would do my best to get them from Dr Shimazu. I had cooperated with his 'teaching' and should be able to get answers if I ask correctly.]"

    w "[[I still sighed heavily before turning the handle to the classroom door though. With any luck I would be here before him, but figures my luck was never that consistent.]"

    w "[[Dr Shimazu sat at his usual desk, reading yet another book while leaning back on his chair with his shoes propped on the desk.]"

    w "[[Does he live here?]"

    w "[[\"No.\" Of course that's not the case, but it was worth asking even if silently. I just made my way to the desk I always sit at and settled down.]"

    w "[[I took a deep breath before attemtping to talk.]"

    w "...Uhm-"

    w "[[So far my attempt was failing.]"

    w "No book for me today? "

    sh "..."

    w "[[I sort of figured he wouldn't answer a question so obvious, not to mention it wasn't really a question I was interested in seeing answered anyway. My approach is too far from what I wanted, so I decided to ask directly.]"

    w "Why am I here? "

    sh "[[Without even a glance departing from his book Dr Shimazu spoke.]"

    sh "Because this is your class, Mr Armstrong. Or have you already forgotten that? "

    w "[[Before coming here today I was telling myself a headstrong approach for getting answers was the best approach, but I had somehow lost my resolve. I grew frustrated until I no longer cared about my approach.]"

    w "I know why I'm present, but why was I admitted?!"

    w "I know you know my staion. I know you know my blood is tainted and impure, also that my magic is weak. "

    w "Then you must know why I was brought to Praesentia. "

    w "[[Finally the doctor cracked and let out a deep sigh while he closed his book and placed it on his desk.]"

    sh "You\'re a curious one aren\'t you? "

    w "[[The doctor opened a drawer to his desk and from within it picked up a ping pong ball.]"

    sh "That\'s good, it means you're always welcoming to knowledge. "

    w "..."

    sh "There is always one of us each generation. Quite shockingly it was not a Hito this time, but a Hackett. "

    w "[[Dr Shimazu place the ping pong ball directly in front of him and let go. It sat suspended in front of him with no aid.]"

    sh "What\'s even more distressing is that the Hackett found with this rare gift can hardly be called a divine...but we intend to make you into one. "

    sh "Catch!" 

    w "[[The ball flew towards me at an astonishing speed. Even though I was trying my best to focus on it with my magic and bring it to a halt it still smacked me square in the face. If I was bright or quick enough, perhaps I would've thought to use my hand where magic failed.]"

    w "Ow. "

    w "[[I said that even though it didn't actually hurt.]"

    w "[[Using my hand I caught the ball before it bounced too far.]"

    sh "You see Mr Armstrong, there must always be someone like us. "

    w "I\'m not sure that answers my quesion."

    w "[[Imitating my teacher I held the ball in front of me and let go. I was overwhelmingly satisfied to see it levitate before me.]"

    sh "Then let me spell it out for you. You were brought to Praesentia because you can make that ball, and soon many other things, levitate. "

    w "[[Surprisingly the doctor didn't sound impatient with his response, instead he seemed rather understanding.]"

    sh "Now if you don't mind passing it back..."

    w "[[I moved the ball towards him at a comprehensible speed before I felt his magic intervene when it got close to him. He then made the ball go around his head reminding me of a comet in orbit before it started coming back.]"

    w "[[I repeated what my teacher had done and the ball was revolving around us like that for a little while before I got curious again.]"

    w "Why must there always be someone like us? How come only one per generation? "

    sh "I have spoken enough for today. Time will bring more answers. "

    w "[[For once I wasn't really upset from the lack of information. I had heard what I wanted to hear, and this was the first thing that the doctor had done that could remotely be called a lesson.]"

    w "[[It was my power that had brought me here, and from what I was told it was rare. I couldn't help but feel like there was more to it though. This magic had to have another reason for being special.]"

    w "[[I realized now that everything that had happened to me recently was due to my magic, and compared to my life before Praesentia this was a life of luxury.]"

    w "[[Even though I had treated most of these recent events like bad luck it was actually good fortune. All of it happened because of this telekinetic ability.]"

    w "[[For the first time ever I felt proud that my magic had gotten me this far, and I figured if I continued to rely on it I can get further. So I decided that it was worth getting stronger so that I can rely on my magic even more.] "

    w "What exactly are you trying to find out? "

    a "Nothing particularly important, I just like to know what I'm up against. But there is something I'm curious about: how did you accomplish being accepted into Praesentia mid-semester?"

    a "You must be pretty good then?"

    w "[[I'm going to pretend she means magic-wise.]"

    w "Really? Hmmm..."

    w "So you know too then? "

    #A nod from Mitsuyo

    m "I don't keep secrets from Mitsuyo, or any of those in my cabinet. You can safely assume that whatever you tell me they will also know. That works vise versa too."

    w "Means less talking for me then. "

    m "I don't do it for you or anyone else. Information should be known by everyone so that less energy is needed when completing a task. "

    w "..."

    mi "The Hito clan has trained skilled infiltrators since the beginning in order to manage the feuds that take place between the Hacketts and the Heidlers. Because we have known it has been easier to act."

    m "It has always simply been a precaution to avoid what is inevitable, but if there was a way to stop the inevitable for good, would you take any action necessary to obtain it? "

    w "By inevitable you mean the wars that the my family has fought with the Heidlers?" 

    m "What else? "

    w "If war can be avoided then yes. "

    mi "Yet there is no peace that cannot be obtained without war. "

    w "I'm not sure I believe that. "

    m "You interpret it the wrong way, that's why. "

    m "The saying that has been passed down by our clan is not to mean that war is the way to obtain peace, just that one cannot exist without the other. Where there is night, there is also day. Do you understand?"

    w "...I guess. "

    m "So if you completely rid the world of the possibility of war, then what do you have?"

    m "The only thing that can be agreed is that peace is peace. "

    w "[[More nonsense.]"

    w "What does this all have to do with everyone being informed then? "

    m "Just that knowledge is a very valuable tool in keeping peace and winning war. "

    w "..."

    w "So do you know a way to stop war from ever taking place between the Heidlers and Hacketts again?"

    m "I am the son of God Wyatt, of course I know a way. "

    w "[[I thought it good to say more, or at least inquire about this 'way' that Moriya seemed so confident in. It piqued my curiousity.]"

    w "[[As I was about to ask though Mitsuyo pulled my sleeve and I looked back at her. All she did was shake her head apparently guessing what I was going to do.]"

    w "[[So we walked silently for no more than a minute before Moriya had spoken again.]"

    m "There's the target. Mitsuyo scan his Asla."

    w "[[Target?]"

    #Mitsuyo nods

    mi "It's him. "

    m "Alright, let's catch up to him. "

    w "[[Judging from the colors on his uniform it was clear that the person in question was a Hackett, I wasn't sure where this was going, but I wasn't liking the vibe so far.]"

    w "[[We circled around the building in the opposite direction. My guess was to cut off the individual. I followed Mitsuyo matching her speed of a light jog while Moriya teleported halfway to the approximate destination.]"

    w "[[By the time Mitsuyo and I circled the building Moriya was already there talking to the individual. The Hackett, whoever he was, seemed pretty frightened.]"

    w "[[Moriya was conversing with the Hackett, but I couldn't tell what they had been talking about. When I got closer I was picking up the last parts of their talk.]"

    m "-sounds to me like you've just been rather lazy of late then. I don't know what you thought you could get away with, but when I make a request I expect it to be fulfilled. "

    ha "Yes of course! I'm very sorry, it won't ever happen again. "

    w "[[The Hackett was on his knees while he apologized and looked somewhat hysterical after discovering that Mitsuyo and I had turned the corner. Although I'm sure the change of emotion was more due to Mitsuyo's presence rather than my own.]"

    m "You're right, it won't happen again. I've found other means of obtaining what I want from a new source. You are relieved of your duties. "

    ha "...What?"

    m "Did I stutter? Forgive me it must have been a mumble actually, I've been picking up the bad habits from some of my subjects. "

    m "I'll repeat myself: you are relieved of your duties. "

    ha "..."

    w "[[The Hackett seemed surprised that he was getting off this easily. I was surprised too. Even though I had no idea what was going on two things were clear: one; the Hackett seemed to be in trouble, and two; Moriya was mad.]"

    w "[[Everyone on Earth knows that he is one individual that should never be mad.]"

    w "[[Not willing to push his luck he picked up his bag and started walking past Moriya towards Mitsuyo and me.]"

    m "Stop. "

    w "[[The Hackett complied.]"

    m "Don't ever make me repeat myself. "

    w "[[Everything that happened next was very sudden.]"

    w "[[Mitsuyo raised her right hand and snapped her fingers and a deafening noise followed suit.]"

    w "[[The Hackett was thrown back against a wall by what appeared to be a shockwave, it had appeared that he stayed stuck to a wall for a second before gravity forced him to the hard ground.]"

    w "[[Now he sat in a daze, blood dropping from his nose and ears with his eyes completely bloodshot, this was not even mentioning the blood running down his neck from his head hitting the surface of the building at blinding speeds.]"

    #I'm sure a good "HOLYSHITWHATTHEHELLHAPPENED" face from Wyatt and some dark music will add to the mood here. 

    w "..."

    w "[[Mitsuyo walked to the Hackett and kneeled down to whisper in his ear...the gesture appeared very seductive. Meanwhile she pulled the Asla off his left arm and removed a chip from the underside.]"

    w "[[When she finished with that the volume of her voice increased gradually unitl the Hacket was snapped out of his stupor and began blocking his ears of all sound, or at least he was trying to, and it didn't seem to be working.]"

    w "[[He began to scream at the top of his lungs, but no matter what I could still hear the voice of Mitsuyo over him. She was whispering some sort of prayer.] "

    w "[[It was a whisper that somewhow overpowered the agonizing scream of a grown man.]"

    w "[[It was for a quick second that I picked up movement from the corner of my eye. 'Yes! Someone has to hear this right?' The movement was that of a professor of some sort rounding the corner. He saw what was going on and simply walked away!]"

    w "[[I could only guess now what I had gotten myself into.]"

    w "[[The screams of the Hackett began to fail him and it transformed into that of a forced groan until both his hands and his head dropped. His body was sitting against the wall limp and the kneeling Mitsuyo rose.]"

    w "[[She walked to Moriya and handed him the chip that she removed from the Hackett's Asla.]"

    m "Thank you."

    w "[[Mitsuyo shut her eyes and bowed to the now pleased Moriya.]"

    m "There you have it Wyatt. Mitsuyo neutralized the target, now you can do your thing without him moving. "

    w "W-"

    w "[[I almost said 'what,' but I just saw what happened when Moriya had to repeat himself. Whether this always happened or he was just saying as much was not the question, I got the hint.]"

    w "-All right. "

    w "[[I was still very tired from my core class and having used my magical ability to keep up with Dr Shimazu, but I conjured as much energy as I could. It didn't take me long to realize it wasn't enough.]"

    w "[[How does one use telekinesis for self-defense anyways? I actually knew the answer to that question though.]"

    w "[[With all my strength I had only managed to toss the Hackett a little to the left. I had nothing else.]"

    w "Mhm! Yeah...definitely not as impressive as you Mitsuyo. "

    w "[[Honestly I was happy to see I hadn't done more damage to the already damaged body.]"

    w "[[Moriya's face changed rather quickly at that.]"

    m "I was expecting a poor performance, but not that poor. "

    w "[[He seemed to be thinking very hard. I only hoped I wouldn't suffer the same fate as the fellow Hackett before me.]"

    w "[[I looked at Mitsuyo for some comfort, but I couldn't find any. She just looked back, with the most amused expression she could probably manage.]"

    #Mitsuyo equates to more of the kuudere deal. Her expression won't differ as much as others. 

    w "Sorry. "

    m "No need to be. Mitsuyo leave the body and escort Wyatt to his class. I'll have a solution to this problem before sundown. "

    w "[[Considering what I had just experienced which was nothing short than jumping a student foe seemingly no reason, the response from Moriya was anti-climactic, but I was willing to accept that.]"

    w "[[After some time I tried talking to Mitsuyo.]"

    w "Is he mad? "

    mi "Seems worried actually. "

    w "[[Back to the calm whisper.]"

    w "How can you tell?"

    mi "..."

    w "..."

    w "Why did you do that to that Hackett?"

    mi "Why did you try helping? "

    w "[[I was sure it was because I had no choice, or maybe becasue I was afraid. I wasn't sure I guess.]"

    w "[[I didn't want to know why either, so I dropped the conversation. I was shaken by what had happened. I didn't want to know.]"

    w "[[Ignorance will serve me better, if I ever know then I might be the one that Mitsuyo shares her whispers with next.]"

    w "[[When we got to my classroom I said one last thing.]"

    w "Thanks."

    w "[[I looked at her raven hair as she silently bowed her head and left.]"
    
    #TODO: Transition to commute train.
    
    w "..."

    w "[[The afternoon classes passed by uneventful as usual. I found paying attention to these subjects a little more interesting than the lessons that Dr Shimazu has offered so far, but today had been promising.]"

    w "[[With any luck Dr Shimazu would provide better lessons from here on, it was possible that maybe he was just trying to test my resolve or something.]"

    w "[[What was mostly on my mind though were the events that took place during lunch. They had been troubling to say the least, but I had no idea what would result from my friendship with Moriya.]"

    w "[[Anyways I was on the commuter train on my way to my dorm when there was knock on the cabin's door.]"
 
    w "Come in. "

    w "[[The door slid open and behind it was a familiar face with familiar company. Like last time she was th only one to enter. She even had a suitcase, just like last time.]"

    #Let a note be known that Jodie appears to be more serious than her usual professionalism.

    j "Good evening Mr Armstrong. How's your time in Praesentia progressing so far? "

    w "[[She took a seat across from me as she asked.]"

    w "I was just thinking about it actually. It's been both promising and worrisome. "

    j "Very worrisome indeed. "

    w "???"

    j "I was going to wait a week before checking up on you, but it seems that I should have checked on you sooner after today's events. "

    w "[[I think I knew where this was going.]"

    j "Had I known you were going to choose His Holiness to be in your company I would have been more proactive in finding you a friend on your first day. Perhaps a nice Hackett girl to lead you away from 'bad company'. "

    j "Forgive me I should not regard His holiness in such a manner. "

    w "I didn't really have a choice. "

    j "In meeting him of course, but sticking around was a choice as well. "

    w "I'm sorry "

    j "No reason to apologize to me Wyatt. I will not dictate who you spend your time with. "

    j "I think you'll be happy to hear that the Hackett you attacked only suffered from minor internal injuries and moderate hearing loss. It seems Her highness Mitsuyo was merciful in her pleasure this time. "

    j "He is expected to recover and should be back in his dorm tonight under close surveillance. Unfortunately his hearing will take some time to return to normal, but he will be attending classes as usual. "

    w "That's good news. "

    j "Indeed. "

    w "Thanks for coming to tell me that, I really do appreciate it."

    j "You're welcome Mr Armstrong, but that's not why I am here."

    w "???"

    j "It would seem His holiness has addressed the Student Council President with his concerns and as the Hackett representative I was entrusted with the task of delivering your safety. "

    w "'Deliver' my safety. "

    j "The families closests to the Hackett main branch are the only ones that knew of your tainted blood. It seems that is no longer the case, but it still remains scarcely known. "

    w "[[Jodie gave me the suitcase. I opened it and my heart skipped a beat upon seeing its contents.]"

    w "[[A gun!]"

    #Wyatt, if shown. Should have a very scared expression.

    j "It comes with a shoulder holster so that you can conceal it in your uniform and it is a compact version so it will be barely noticeable. The ID in the case will silence any inquiries concerning the firearm by professors and administrative staff. "

    j "It would seem his holiness Moriya Hito didn't want you left unprotected. "

    w "...And, the student council approved of this? "

    j "I am not acing on behalf of the Student Council, I am acting on behalf of Hito interests. "

    j "It would seem many eyes have fallen upon you. That includes the eyes of the Heidler faction and I promise you after today's events the Hackett family will be keeping an eye on you as well. "

    w "I was dragged along. "

    j "An email will be distributed tonight to all Hacketts that your whereabouts, whether suspicious or ordinary, be reported. "

    w "I didn't know where he was taking me. "

    j "I'm not saying any of it was your fault Mr Armstrong. A Hito can attack a Hackett or Heidler indiscriminately, but keeping track of our own is easier to excuse than keeping track of a Hito. "

    j "I hope you understand. You have not made bad friends, in fact I would congratulate you on making it this far in such a short amount of time. I envy you even. "

    j "But until we are sure that these are just random acts of His Holiness and that you are not the cause it is necessary that we commit to some form of surveillance. "

    w "[[That was more assuring. I was almost positive that they were turning against me because I unintentionally aided Moriya in jumping an innocent student. A Hackett of all people.]"

    #Now Wyatt looks relieved.

    w "So you're saying I can still trust in you for help? Because I'm a little lost here." 

    j "Of course, so long as we feel we can trust in you. I certainly hope we're on the same side. "

    w "[[She extended her hand for a handshake.]"

    w "I'm sure we are."

    w "[[I accepted her handshake. Her hand was soft.]"

    j "Very good. We may ask you to do things from time to time, I hope you will do your best to comply to those as well."

    w "I'll do what I can. "

    j "I hope so Mr Armstrong. "

    w "[[She began to leave the compartment but looked back one last time to confirm the resolve that I held.]"

    j "I encourage you to hold the firearm on you whenever you can. It'll make His holiness feel comfortable, and more importantly it will make me feel safe. "

    w "Thank you. "

    w "[[Instead of leaving the cabin like I had anticipated though she unexpectedly sat back down, this time with a more somber look and tone.]"

    j "Did you at least try your best?"

    w "Try my best at what?"

    j "At harming the Hackett you guys jumped today. "

    w "[[Now I was really confused. Who's side was anyone on!?]"

    w "Umm..."

    j "Magic can be a thousand times more lethal than a firearm or a nuke depending on the individual, but it can also be a thousand times less lethal. By presenting you this firearm I have taken away your ability to control that lethality."

    j "Forget about what I just asked you, but promise me the next time you have a Hackett in your sights, you'll hold back as much as you can with that."

    w "[[She gestured toward the suitcase in my hand.]"

    j "We need to do our best to take care of our own, we already have a powerful enemy. "

    w "I understand. Trust me, I don't plan on taking anyones life. I certainly hope Moriya isn't expecting me to either. "

    w "[[Her usual professional demeanor returned but her smile seemed very genuine. With that she stood up again and left this time. I assumed her two 'bodyguards' followed behind her where ever she was heading.]"

    w "[[I looked at the open suitcase upon my lap. The gun was fit snugly in some foam and that shoulder holster Jodie mentioned was placed off to the side.]"

    w "[[I closed the case. I shouldn't be too surprised really. I knew coming to this school would be a mess, I was just hoping I wouldn't get myself too far in it. It seems that hope was for nothing.]"

    w "[[Thinking about what had happened didn't matter anymore, I had to start thinking about what was going to happen.]"

    w "[[I was going to have a hard time going to sleep tonight.]"
    
    #TODO: Transition to end day

    #Hackett POV

    narrate "[[Jodie Lawson waited out the trip inside of a cabin that housed her and the two others that always tailed her for safety. They were part of the Student Council Disciplinary Committee under the Master of Arms and were assigned to her by him too.]"

    narrate "[[She didn't mind them. They were like robots and didn't speak unless spoken to and were good about lending her privacy when she asked. She would need that privacy pretty soon.]"

    narrate "[[During the trip she was just running through files on her Asla that were Student Council related and also worked on the emails that would need to be sent promptly at midnight. Of course she didn't need to be up for it, she just needed to type the email. The Asla did the rest.]"

    narrate "[[The train was at the dorm station which is where all the students attending Praesentia stayed during their time of study, except maybe a few higher class Hitos that had residense in the nearby city.]"

    narrate "[[Jodie exited the train into the station.]"

    j "I'll be at my dorm in twenty minutes. You're dismissed. "

    narrate "[[The two gentlemen checked their Aslas for the time and departed from her. The dorm station ran right through the dorms with male and female dorms split by the track. It was an interesting structure that easily caught the eye of many.]"

    narrate "[[She had an appointment to keep and she headed toward the rendezvous with her usual haste.]"

    narrate "[[When she met her appointment she was the first to speak.]"

    j "Is this completely neceassary? "

    e "You should address his divine grace in a better tone. "

    narrate "[[Christopher raised his hand slowly gesturing Evelyn to stop and of course she listened.]"

    ch "Probably not. "

    ch "In fact I think it to be complete waste of resources. He's no one to be troubled about, most likely just another pawn. "

    j "Then why the caution. We did not do this with Mr Grayson. "

    ch "The fact that His Holiness Moriya would find interest in a pig like William doesn't surprise me though. The fact that he would find interest in someone like Wyatt does. "

    ch "If I'm right then it will only be a few days before we can allocate our time to more important things. Make it known in the email that it will only be a temporary deal. "

    j "If you're so confident this will blow over than why even bother. "

    ch "Because there is always the possibility that I could be wrong."

    narrate "[[The two with Chris were struck by a brief moment of silence, neither would admit that someone like Chris could ever be wrong. Thus is the way of the world.]"

    ch "If I had to speculate, it is Moriya that has been acting strange lately. Remember this is just a guise, it's him that we're trying to watch. You did tell Wyatt that right?"

    j "Of course. "

    ch "We're Hacketts Jodie. We've gotten this far playing it safe. Even the Heidlers have chosen to take a more conservative approach, do you know why?  "

    j "His Holiness. "

    ch "Exactly. No one likes it when he gets involved. Bad things happen. "

    j "It's a shame he couldn't pick up anything from his father. "

    ch "And the fathers before his fathers, but even at their very best things have always been . . . a little tense. "

    narrate "[[All of a sudden Chris wrapped an arm around Jodie, much to her discontent.]"

    ch "You see Jodie, the world sucked with good people leading it. It's just the calm before the strom until Moriya does something extremely stupid."

    ch "When that happens we just have to make sure we're prepared." 

    narrate "[[Jodie shook herself free of Chris.]"

    ch "It'll be just like the generational wars that took place some thousand years ago. "

    j "Yeah, but I'm afraid of what those would look like now. Magic and weapons that allow the use of it are much more advanced. You remember the last war. "

    ch "...We all do. "

    ch "Anyways, I got classes to attend. I'll catch you ladies later. "

    narrate "[[Chris left the two behind by making his way to the station.]"

    e "Your questioning attitude and clear disgust are traits of you lacking faith in him. "

    #A super bright smile from Jodie here would be awesome.
