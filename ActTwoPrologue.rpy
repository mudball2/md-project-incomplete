label prologueActTwo:

    #The beginning of Act II, finally! Unlike Act I, I have no outline to work from and this will completely be done by sheer imagination and hoping the pieces fit together. This Act is not supposed to add anything too deep into story elements, but rather just a shit ton of dying. So if any ideas emerge about deaths and the magic involving it please let me know.

    #Next part is Hackett POV, use narrate. OPEN TO DISCUSSION: What comes first, the letter or the Hackett POV?

    #CG Maybe? Forresty BG with stars clearly visible and pretty with lake sounds. Steal from YouTube.

    narrate "[[The night was deathly quiet and neither an insect, wolf nor owl made any sound in the peaceful darkeness.]"

    narrate "[[It was a moonless night and the stars reflected heavenly from the lake before Evelyn, displaying a marvelous masterpiece of art that only nature could create.]"

    narrate "[[Despite it being considerably far into Spring the night still carried the dying chills of the last winter within its breeze, but it did not bother her one bit.]"

    narrate "[[Evelyn stripped herself from her shoes and her stockings so that she could dip her feet into the cool water. From there she just waded along the lake shore as she had done many nights alone.]"

    narrate "[[A peace on Earth she hoped she could one day share.]"

    narrate "[[...She was waiting for somebody.]"

    narrate "[[The lake was not on the campus grounds or very close to it at all. It was actually some ways from the base of the mountains and it would be much easier to get here from the dorms than from the campus.]"

    narrate "[[It was a trip that Evelyn only made when business awaited her ears, but she had yet to hear anyhting this night. Only the waking of the small lake waves as they met the shore.]"

    narrate "[[It was too quiet really, at least relative to most nights.]"

    narrate "[[Perhaps the wildlife of the world was mourning the blood spilled on this day, or maybe the Earth has it's way of warning her children when gods wage war.]"

    #Gun cocks

    narrate "[[The noise startled Evelyn, though she did not show it. Even if she knew it was threatful a gun would not take her down.]"

    narrate "[[She turned around slowly to confront her visitors.]"

    narrate "[[Twenty-one in total. Only one of them was important and his sidearm was still strapped around his waist. Those accompanying him where clad in the latest magic ward armor and holding the most advanced MATec assault rifles.]"

    narrate "[[Evelyn made her way  out of the shallow water to kneel to her one true king, a god of the known world.]"

    e "A-a fine evening your grace."

    l "Following a disastrous series of events! "

    l "It's not easy coming here on short notice and without detection. I want details!"

    e "A Hackett and a Heidler lie dead. "

    l "No fucking shit. Why? "

    narrate "[[Chris sounded a lot like his father, and the accent of the Isles didn't make it any better. When Chris' father was mad she couldn't help but imagine Chris yelling at her when she was kneeling like this.]"

    narrate "[[She didn't know what to do. Should she lie to His Grace to protect Chris? It was afterall a duty that she was entrusted with, but did that include protecting Chris from his own father? The one who had given her the order.]"

    narrate "[[What was worst is that her truth was only an assumption.]"

    e "C-Chris-"

    narrate "[[A deep sigh escaped Laurence's breath.]"

    l "Damn that boy. "

    l "Any other time and I would've praised his assertive action, but now is not that time."

    narrate "[[He rubbed his eyes as if he had recieved little sleep before arriving.]"

    l "Why? Did he at least have a plan? "

    e "...I...I don't know."

    l "You don't know? You're supposed to aren't you? "

    e "I'm sorry your grace! He has not been himself lately, a-at least not towards me."

    narrate "[[There was a pause.]"

    l "...That's unfortunate."

    narrate "[[The Hackett king walked past a frightened Evelyn up to the lakes shore where he gazed up at the stars.]"

    l "A war is coming Miss Logan. I'm not sure when or how, but this mess has blown everything out of proportion. It is only a matter of time."

    l "The Hitos are getting lazy, choosing such a crude manner of resolving this conflict. What's more is that no intervention is allowed inside the academy. You'll be on your own Miss Logan."

    l "They're going to put up a perimeter so I won't be able to come visit after this. No one will."

    l "His life is now more than ever in your hands. "

    l "I will do my best to fight the war outside the academy, you do your best to make sure my son does the same on the inside. "

    l "I have a feeling that if the war starts, it'll be here that it does."

    e "I understand Your Grace. "

    l "I hope so Miss Logan. "

    l "Make sure he has way of getting an heir for himself soon too."

    l "Now if you'll excuse me, I have a war to win. With any luck I'll make it the last war for many years to come. "

    narrate "[[Laurence turned quickly back into the forest and all but one of his guard followed suit. As Evelyn rose from her knees the guard approached her.]"

    g "Here!"

    narrate "[[He tossed her an Asla.]"

    g "A full military grade mock up for your SLA, no limits. Use it if you have to."

    narrate "[[Evelyn nodded and the guard made haste to catch up with the rest.]"

    narrate "[[It was deathly quiet again.]"

    narrate "[[Stroking the ribbon in her hair she thought of her next move.]"

    narrate "..." 

    narrate "... ..."

    narrate "... ... ..."

    #The Screen starts black, the following letter text could be centered but I'll leave it to the programmer to decide.

    centered "Dear Wyatt,"

    centered "Don't worry, I'm not mad that it took you this long to finally get back to me."

    centered "Why email? I'm sure this could have easily been a video call, but I'll go easy on you. I forget that you haven't had too many oppurtunities to play with modern technology."

    centered "Are you okay? What's going on over there?"

    centered "The news has gotten out about the murder that took place at Praesentia, I hope you were far from it when it happened."

    centered "The peace between the Hacketts and Heidlers has crumbled as a result. There have been reports that fleets and armies under Heidler control have been encroaching on the Western continent."

    centered "Of course the Hacketts have responded to this by launching their own armies. My dad has become increasingly more busy as the tensions continue to rise."

    centered "They say the murder was planned by the Hacketts, that they wanted war and now we will have it should anything look remotely hostile."

    centered "My dad says it's wise to take the defense for now."

    centered "He doesn't want another war, but I can't help but feel like it's inevitable. Everyone high born wants to see blood, the feud is so alive in them."

    centered "Maybe if the Cartwright name still held weight my father's word would be considered more and a peaceful solution could be met."

    centered "This isn't your fault though Wyatt. I hope you've seen the last of it at Praesentia. Just keep to your studies and stay strong until they no longer need you for whatever it is they want you for."

    centered "Sorry about the bad news. I should be encouraging you, right? How's your new life? Have you made any friends? Any girls?"

    centered "I hope to hear back from you soon, and learn to make video calls. Emails are too old school!"

    centered "Your friend,"

    centered "Alyssa Cartwright"
