    #This part will somewhat experimental. Even though it was decided from the start how Act I should end over the course of me typing this crap story up, it wasn't exactly all thought out. In other words how it will end was decided, but how it plays up to that point was not.

    #commuter train

    w "[[This was the email I woke up to this morning. It appears that the Asla acts as an alarm clock when urgent news such as this is being transmitted through it. I suppose that meant territory disputes betwen Hacketts and Heidlers didn't count as urgent.]"

    w "[[It goes without saying that the death of one of them is.]"

    w "[[I was sitting in a cabin of the commuter train on my way to the academy, as it should be it was a lot more crowded this morning. I ended up in a cabin with with all girls...]"

    w "[[...It would appear my luck was very inconsistent.]"

    w "[[Not like any of us were talking anyway, plus the look on my face this morning probably resembled that of a war veteran or something of the sorts. I was the only one in the cabin that knew.]"

    w "[[Quite frankly this is one moment where I wish i knew nothing.]"

    w "*Sigh"

    w "[[I rubbed my eyes. As expected I didn't sleep last night.]"

    w "[[My robust sigh earned me the looks of my traveling companions. They started whispering silently to each other afterwards.]"

    w "[[I couldn't quite make out everything they were saying.]"

    #I had originally put dialogue hear between the Hacket girls, but I found it to be rathe distracting, plus I'm unfamiliar with how girls gossip.

    w "[[I tried to drown out their words though. In the process it seems I was able to catch a little shut eye before making it to the Academy.]"

    w "..."

    #I suppose some sort of auditorium would do for a BG, although it wouldn't be too important

    w "[[It was crowded here too. The academy schedule ran 24-hours and on a block schedule, usually there wasn't even this much students on campus unless some sort of special event was going on.]"

    w "[[I guess this would qualify as a special event.]"

    w "[[It was fifteen minutes after the time specified on the email, I assume that classes are excused until this event was over.]"

    w "[[When movement finally began to take place on the stage a restrained Hackett and a line of men from I assumed the student council took their places at the stage.]"

    w "[[With them was Mitsuyo, Jodie, and another man.]"

    w "[[Any background noise was silenced as Jodie approached the microphone.]"

    j "Thank you all for coming. We are glad to see that attendance has peaked and appreciate that all of you have made an effort to be here today."

    w "[[The building was as quiet as a graveyard.]"

    j "Although it is unfortunate that we had to gather all of you under these circumstances. Without further delay, a word from your student body president."

    w "[[Mitsuyo stayed still.]"

    mi "..."

    mi "Under Ariticle three of the Student Code of conduct no student is to be armed outside of a relevant course material study unless it is registered or distributed by the student and administrative governing body."

    w "[[She wasn't usin the microphone as Jodie had, but her voice was loud and cold. Like she was still whispering as always, but to where everyone can hear in that huge packed auditorium.]"

    mi "Alexander Kelly has been found guilty of violating this clause and several witnesses have attested to this. "

    w "[[This is stupid! Where did they find witnesses so quickly to attest something that isn't true!?]"

    mi "Under Eastern law no individual should be found carrying an unregistered firearm on Hito lands and any registered user should carry their license on their person at all times. "

    mi "Alexander Kelly has been found guilty of violating this law."

    mi "Under Eastern law any act of unjust murder carried out by an individual is to be duly punished for such a crime under the Hito Fair Punishment Act."

    mi "Alexander Kelly has been found guilty of murder and his punishment for said crime has been considered."

    mi "Under International law wriiten in the last armistice no Hackett should take the life of a Heidler or vice versa in the likely event that a new war will erupt."

    mi "...Alexander Kelly has violated this clause."

    w "[[All of a sudden the auditorium erupted with chaos. Heidler's cried for justice. Hackett's accused of injustice.]"

    w "[[Why did they care!? There didn't know what happened this didn't involve any of them!]"

    w "[[Just a bunch of high born individuals arrogant enough to play a hero in this whole feud that has goten nowhere in the past couple millenia.]"

    w "[[How on Earth did it even last this long? Surely some higher power was keeping it that way. After knowing Moriya for less than a week I was sure that was the case. Maybe all Hitos just have this pretentious image of a benevolent person.]"

    w "[[In reality the gods of the world were maybe just the demons running it.]"

    w "[[Every plebe in this world would bow to anyone in here. They would pray to and worship them as well.]"

    w "[[Would they still do it after seeing the true inner working like I have?]"

    w "[[Mitsuyo raised her right hand and snapped her fingers. The sound rang so loud over the crowd that structure shook, in doing so it quelled the shouts of the auditorium.]"

    w "[[She continued.]"

    mi "Under the International World Treaty Organization's eighty-sixth amendment the matter has been taken up to His High Holiness Tatsuya Hito. Who has fairly judged that the death of Alexander Kelly 'will' subdue all future qualms in this matter."

    w "[[At least half of the auditorium cheered.]"

    mi "And this demonstration 'will' show what happens to disturbers of the peace."

    alx "Wait!! I-It wasn't me! It wasn't me!!!"

    w "[[The auditorium was loud now. Filled with cheers, taunts, and disapproval.]"

    w "[[A line of men clad in the student uniform approached the restrained Hackett and raised their Asla bearing hands towards him.]"

    alx "Jackson!!! It wasn't me!!!"

    w "[[Some of the cheering got louder and louder.]"

    w "[[The men that made up the execution line readied their Aslas and beams of energy shot out from them melting through the flesh of his body and setting fire to the rest.]"

    w "[[As his lifeless body burned and popped from the heat the cheering and noise stopped.]"

    w "[[Jodie apporached the microphone once more.]"

    j "That will be all for todays demonstration, please return to your usual schedules and enjoy the rest of your day. "

    w "[[The stadium erupted to life and everyone Hitos, Hacketts, and Heidlers had something to say about the spectacle that had just taken place.]"

    w "[[Hacketts expressed anger, Heidlers expressed joy, and whether the Hitos were serious about it or not, they expressed disapproval.]"

    #May use another word for disapproval at some point.

    w "[[I was certainly angry with my kin, but probably not for the same reasons.]"

    w "[[I sat in my seat until most had left and then proceeded to exit from the grandoise auditorium.]"

    w "[[I walked into a restroomand into a stall.]"

    #May add a decision here, but for now anger will be Wyatt's response.

    w "[[Just like last night I punched the stall's wall and opened the wound on my knuckles from yesterday.]"

    w "Shit!"

    w "[[Still though, I couldn't help but think that it actually went better than expected. It was perhaps luck that prevent that whole auditorium from turning into a warzone.]"

    w "[[I realized though that the same could be said for last night.]"

    w "[[William and Hans were both holding back a great deal of what was their true magical potential.]"

    w "[[...]"

    w "[[It was the Hitos again.]"

    w "[[The Heidlers and Hacketts respect them too much to go about breaking what belongs to them, just to use it as a place for killing rather than a battlefield itself.]"

    w "[[I don't know how long it'll be before that changed now that things changed for the worse.]"

    w "[[I didn't want to go to any of my classes. I instead made my way to the dorms.]"

    w "... ... ..."
