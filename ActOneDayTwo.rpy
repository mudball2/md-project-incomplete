    #I think that it's important to not let it begin the same way everytime as it may bring about a more predictable story than the one I'm already composing. 
    #I think if I just let it flow straight to the more important parts of the daily activities of our MC it would be alright, but what do I know?  I'm no professional writer or nothing.  Maybe it would've helped to take some creative writing courses or something.  All the nonsense I write just falls out of my brain as a gooey substance that I try to make solid.  
    #Hopefully by the end of this I'll make something seemingly credible for avid visual novel readers.  Here I am ranting and stuffs, time to get to the story.

    w "[[I think I was beginning to understand Dr. Shimazu a little better as a result.  I already knew how to use my magic, there was no need to teach me.  Even without a lesson I was able to use the power within me, and by doing so strengthen it.]"

    ##//Heidler POV//

    narrate "[[There were many things that Anya had come to dislike within the last twenty-four hours; an insult from a Hackett, a loss of ground to a Hackett, and now...intrusion by a Hackett.  The crest said it all.]"

    narrate "[[It was mocking to the Heidlers, and more importantly it was mocking her.  She would not stand for such insolence. She was a goddess and princess of the holy throne and she would not stand being mocked.]"

    narrate "[[Anya approached the table that Niklas and Lukas had chosen for dining, seeing Lukas seated there she did her best not to look so upset.  She was displeased that she had lost her composure in front of him last night and did not want to repeat it.]"

    narrate "[[To the unknowing eye it had appeared that she had casually sat next to Niklas and embraced his arm.]"

    n "No food today, Anya?"

    a "A stench made me lose my appetite."

    n "A stench? "

    l "A Hackett your Holiness. "

    n "A Hackett? "

    narrate "[[Anya placed a hand on Niklas' lap and shot a jolt of electricity through his body which caused him to slam his knee under the picnic table.]"

    n "Agh!!"

    l "Your Holiness!?"

    n "It\'s nothing!"

    #Perhaps a grin out of Anya

    n "What of this Hackett?  Is he important?"

    a "Not by the looks of it.  Probably some lackey sent to impose after we took the courtyard.  They're trying to make a statement and it mustn't be allowed. "

    narrate "[[Anya continued to dig her nails into the lap of Niklas.  The fabric of his slacks preventing any real pain, but still enough to send him the message.]"

    n "*Sigh* ...Right. Lukas."

    l "Yes, your Holiness?"

    n "Take Jonas with you and handle it.  See to it that he never returns. "

    l "As you wish. "

    n "There you go Anya. Are you satisfied now? "

    narrate "[[She let go of his lap and arm and stole his apple from his tray and bit into it.  She turned away from the table and faced out. Her legs crossed while holding herself up arrogantly.]"

    n "[[What am I going to do with this girl?]"

    narrate "[[Still...it comforted him to see her do that. It reminded him of when they were kids and they would try to steal each others food for fun. Even if it wasn't playful to the watchful eye, it was a playful gesture to him.]"

    narrate "... ... ..."

    narrate "... ..."

    narrate "..."

    w "[[Heidlers; a lot of them.  It was starting to make me nervous.  Did I miss something important? Perhaps it would've been better to take time to scout a little bit before sitting randomly to eat.]"

    w "[[Was it possible that my magic had me too tired to even remember to do that, or perhaps it was the fact that I was too hungry to care.  Either one was an honest response.]"

    w "[[maybe...it isn't too late to leave.]"

    w "[[I began placing pressure on my legs as a means to casually slip out of this courtyard, when a hand caught me by the shoulder and forced me back down.]"

    w "[[Apparently it was too late.]"

    js "It\'s interesting to see a man hailing from so far West to be enjoying a far East meal, isn't it Lukas? "

    l "Indeed."

    js "Tell me Hackett: Is it usual for your kin to experiment, or do you just like thinking you're better than us? "

    w "...I like food. "

    js "An honest man too! Lukas, I'd say we found a black sheep amongst the Hacketts.  I was sure they were only capable of telling lies!"

    l "Let\'s not jump to conclusions your lordship, he may still be a typical Hackett rat."

    js "Is that what you are mate? A sniveling rat? Or did you just draw the short straw and found yourself here because you really are a black sheep?"

    w "[[They made it sound like they knew who I was.  That couldn't be the case though.]"

    w "[[They're not my higher-ups either though.  I had no obligation to show them respect.]"

    w "I don\'t know what you're talking about."

    js "No?"

    js "Then maybe you know this.  Do you know where you are? "

    w "Praesentia."

    js "A bloody genius too Lukas! "

    w "[[One of them, I'm not sure who, slammed my head against the marble picnic table We were sitting at.  If I wasn't mad before, I was now.]"

    w "[[I knew it was unwise to revolt though, I took a quick look around and saw the other Heidlers that were eating appeared amused by my dilemma.  I was outnumbered. With any luck these guys will get bored of me soon.]"

    w "[[I rubbed my nose since it took the most of the hit.]"

    l "Let me rephrase it for the smartass.  Do you know where you're eating?"

    w "[[I almost said 'a table,' but I got the hint.  I'll just stop being vague with my responses, maybe they'll cut to the chase quicker that way.]"

    w "[[I did my best to recall the school map.]"

    w "The East Courtyard? "

    w "[[I was still unsure, but that seemed to be the answer they wanted.]"

    l "So you did know then?"

    w "[[I was slammed again, but into my meal this time with my head being forced to stay down. .]"

    w "[[What the hell was going on?]"

    w "[[This Lukas character forced my right hand in front of my face without saying anything, forcing my palm onto the table.]"

    w "[[Using some magic unknown to me, the back of my hand went red and a steam wafted from it as if I just dipped it in a pot of boiling water. It felt that way too.]"

    w "!!!"

    w "[[I didn't want to give them the pleasure of screaming, but I did slip a loud grunt.]"

    m "Woah, woah woah! Gentlemen. What seems to be the problem here? "

    w "[[The hands forcing me down went away and I sat up, but the pain still persisted in my hand so I embraced with my other hoping it will ease the burn-like throbbing. The pain was so intense I didn\'t bother wiping my face of food.]"

    js "Your Holiness!"

    js "...We were just taking care of an infestation...feuding business...nothing that should ever concern you, your Holiness. "

    m "But it is my concern, isn't it? I am the Hito heir afterall, but more importantly...that's my friend, not an infestation. "

    w "[[The color vanished from the men next to me as I began to turn around.  What friend?]"

    js "Y-your friend?"

    w "[[After turning around and wiping my face I looked towards the newcomer.  Recognizing him right away I couldn't stop myself from speaking his name.]"

    w "Moriya Hito..."

    w "[[A rude gesture to call him by name, I squeezed my pained hand harder to punish myself. I probably just made the situation worse.]"

    w "[[However this only convinced my attackers more that I was in fact friends with this higher power, and what Moriya said next even had me surprised.]"

    m "And here you are Wyatt, right where I asked you to meet me. "

    m "I must say I\'m quite surprised you held your temper against these boys, you could\'ve brought pain much greater than the little magic trick Lukas here decided to display. "

    w "[[He was bluffing, but only I knew that.  It was the second lie out of this man's mouth. If it wasn't for him saying he was the Hito heir I would've assumed everything he says in life 'was' a lie.]"

    w "[[...but he was very convincing. Wait, how did he know my name?]"

    js "I assure you your Holiness, he hadn't said anything about you meeting with him."

    m "In case you haven\'t noticed Wyatt here isn\'t one for talking. "

    w "[[Moriya approached me and the other two stood aside as he wrapped his arm around me and helped me to stand, although I hardly needed the aid.]"

    m "He waits \'til he has a reason to kill the pests around his eating place.  Like a fly that gets to curious about his meal, or a roach with no sense but to seek a crumb. That, would've been your fates...Swatted and crushed. "

    m "You\'re lucky he was waiting for me, he knows I don't like a mess.  Though it seems you felt obligated to make one."

    l "It wasn\'t our intention to make any messes. "

    m "Of course not.  I would hardly think a lord and a knight are competent enough to make one. "

    m "But let\'s see what Wyatt has to say.  Were these gentlemen giving you any problems? A hard time maybe?"

    m "As you can imagine I'm able to pull the strings really easily around here, especially with the Student Council president being under my belt. I was able to take this room which would normally be used for a school funded club. "

    m "Not particularly large, but it was the view I came to enjoy."

    w "[[And quite a view it was.  The room was situated at the top of the administrative building which sat at the center of campus. The window to the outside overlooked the Hall which was a long strip of grass and decorative flora that ran straight through the middle of campus.]"

    l "Same thing His Holiness said, the two are \"good friends.\""

    a "It\'s possibly the truth. It would explain the late admission and the reason why no one west knows him. "

    a "If he was brought in mid-semester Hito power could have done it, especially at the request of His Holiness Moriya. "

    a "It\'s quite possible that he even lives in this part of the world alongside Hitos, explaiing even further why none of the Hacketts you interigated knew of him. It would also explain why he was eating eastern cuisine as well. "

    l "There are too many blank spaces. "

    a "Right. The only way we can know for sure is to somehow get clarification from the higher born Hacketts. "

    l "That will take some time though. "

    a "Unfortunately. "

    a "Did your girlfriend say anyhting about his magic? "

    l "Funny, for being so close to His Holiness, Yvonne couldn't really tell me anything. "

    a "Remember where we are Lukas. "

    l "It\'s alright, I don't mind. "

    narrate "[[Lukas was too heated and he dove in for more.]"

    narrate "[[Anya placed her index and middle finger against his abdomen when he brough his offensive and shot enough electricity in him to bring him to the floor.]"

    narrate "[[He was groaning in pain and holding both hands close to his stomach.]"

    narrate "[[Anya knelt down and brought her face driectly in front of his.]"

    a "Then do well to remember who you are \'Sir\' Lukas. "

    l "Arggh- Y-yes, your holiness. "

    # Her trademark smile

    a "Very nice, now be a good boy and escort me to the dorms. "

    l "[[Lukas forced himself back up.]"

    l "Yes...your holiness. "

    #Well I'm pretty sure that will conclude day II for now unless someone caught something I should've included.
