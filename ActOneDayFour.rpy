    #This scene will provide a flashback of life for Wyatt before Praesentia. 

    w "[[After waking up today and taking a shower I pulled out the suitcase that Jodie had provided me ysterday and for the first time I thoroughly looked through its contents. She was kind enough to leave instructions for the firearm and its holster.]"

    w "[[It would come as a surprise to many from the Western continent that I had never handled a firearm before, but the only training I had with one was the classes offered in Praesentia regarding military training.]"

    w "[[I put it under my uniform and began making my way to Praesentia. It didn't seem likely I would be using it for anything anyways.]"

    w "..."

    w "[[I entered Dr Shimazu's class only a little early today, and as usual he sat at his desk reading a book about who knows what. I took to my usual seat as well, seeing no reason to disturb him until the time indicated the start of class.]"

    w "[[To my surprise though the usually evasive instructor began speaking without being pushed into it.]"

    sh "Are they issuing students firearms now? I had no idea that war had broken out within the school. "

    w "[[He was clearly being sarcastic.]"

    w "Does it look that obvious?"

    sh "Hardly. I just have a keen eye is all. "

    w "I'm allowed to have it though. "

    sh "I'm sure you are. By the time I'm finished teaching you the extremities of our magic you will be able to stop any bullet coming your way, and even alter the tragectories of your shots to make your aim more true. "

    w "Is that what you'll be teaching me then? "

    sh "No. "

    w "[[He opened a drawer at his desk and pulled out a notebook with lined paper before using his magic to put it on my desk.]"

    sh "Write, no hands. "

    w "Write about what? "

    sh "..."

    w "[[He had already gotten back to his book.]"

    w "..."

    w "[[I pulled out a pen from my pocket and pondered about what to write. Does anyone even use pen and paper for assignments? I thought that was the point of the Asla.]"

    w "[[I guess it was more for the lesson of just making my magic use more precise to where I can pay attention to details while using my abilities.]"

    w "[[Either way though it didn't help me to think what I should write about. I wasn't very creative and wasn't about to make a story up, and there weren't any subjects I knew enough about to explain in detail.]"

    w "[[I started off just putting some random letters and numbers on the page. It must have looked strange to an outsider to see a pen write without a master. Looking at it myself was pretty crazy even though I was the one moving the pen.]"

    w "[[It was immediately known that my handwriting, if one could call it that at this stage, was considerably worse than usual as I continued putting words on the paper. As time progressed though ideas began to form about the past and a story was starting to form...]"

    w "..."

    w "... ... "

    w "... ... ..."

    #We'll see how good I am at writing flashbacks. Not sure if I want to go about this first-person or third-person?

    w "[[The Cartwrights were a small lordship that ruled land to the Northwest of the Western Continent, it was rural region and maintained a large number of plebeians that helped to provide lumber to the continent. Lumber was the region's trade.]"

    #First-person it is then.

    w "[[My family was apparently a vassal to the Cartwrights for hundreds of years as a result of a verdict that condemned a taboo of one of my ancestral relatives. Before the whole mess though it was said that the Armstrong and Cartwright family were friends.]"

    w "[[It was this friendship that apparently saved my entire family line, but as a result the position of the Cartwright family was reduced to a small lordship, and my family was forced to be a vassal.]"

    w "[[The Cartwrights owned a lot of land and on some corner of it was a cabin where me and my family lived. It was cozy, but it was a long walk to get to the main household and serve the family. This usually meant an early rise.]"

    w "[[I use to walk that distance with my dad every morning up to the main household, but since the start of the last war he was always off somewhere far fighting.]"

    w "[[It wasn't ever a problem until other kids of higher social standing found it worth their time to come and jump me on that stretch of woods to the household during weekends. On the weekends I would go to help with household chores as was my duty.]"

    w "[[I would tell a lie to the Cartwright head saying that my bruises and scratches were from me fumbling in the woods, I was sure he knew what was really going on, but he never questioned me further.]"

    car "Just be more careful then. "

    w "[[Is what he would usually say, but he wasn't the only one that knew I was lying.]"

    w "[[One of those weekends I was cleaning a room that was no doubt bigger than the cabin I lived in, when a familiar face poked her head through the door and walked in.]"

    al "A boy shouldn't be alone in a girl's room. "

    w "I should be when it's my job to clean it. "

    al "That's no excuse. How do I know you're not looking places you shouldn't be when I'm not around?"

    w "Because I'm too afraid of getting in trouble for it afterwards, and we're only eight. "

    al "So you're saying when we get older and you aren't afraid you'd do it?"

    w "I didn't say anything close to that. "

    al "That's not what I heard~ Teehee"

    w "Why're you here?"

    al "Why're you hurt? "

    w "..."

    al "Maybe you shouldn't be walking in the woods alone either. There are scary things lurking inside. "

    w "Yeah, like tigers. "

    al "There aren't any tigers here!"

    w "I wouldn't be so sure Alyssa. I was walking through the woods one morning before coming here for school, and a tiger came up beside me! "

    w "You should've seen it! It had big teath and claws! It even purred when I pet it!!"

    al "You're lying!"

    w "Am not! I told your dad that same morning and he believed me. "

    al "You got to pet a tiger?"

    w "Sure did! It was the coolest thing ever. "

    al "So did the tiger come back and attack becasue you suck at petting animals?"

    w "I think a purring tiger means I did a pretty good job. "

    al "Then something else attacked you out in the woods? Some people maybe? "

    w "[[I knew where she was going with this.]"

    w "I don't know what you're talking about. ~Nippa"

    al "Keep it to yourself then. I'll find out the truth soon anyways. "

    w "What does that mean?"

    al "Don't worry about it, come over here. "

    w "[[She grabbed my hands and pulled me from my task and towards the bed. She had me sit on the edge of the bed while she stood before me.]"

    al "Alright, now close your eyes. "

    w "What? "

    al "Just do it. "

    w "[[I closed my eyes like she asked. It's not like I can actually refuse her requests or anything, but I did promptly open them after I felt two hands on my chest.]"

    w "[[Her eyes were closed too so she didn't see me open mine, but I saw what was going on. In an instant a bright flash of light engulfed my chest and not long after my entire body.]"

    w "[[It felt warming, and the bruises and scratches I had procured vanished with a quick chilling sensation specific to their respected locations.]"

    w "[[As quickly as the light had appeared it too subsided, and Alyssa took a deep breath.]"

    al "There you go. Now you can clean my room without any more pain. "

    w "Thanks."

    al "Yeah, just try not to get attacked by any more tigers alright. "

    w "I'll try not to. "

    w "..."

    w "[[Every weekend for a while was like this. I walked in the woods only to be jumped by kids from my school and I would go to clean the main household where Alyssa showed kindness by healing me.]"

    w "[[I told her once that she didn't have to use her magic to heal me. I figured getting attacked was only a once a week thing and I would be healed anyways by the next week.]"

    al "Don't worry about it, it's good practice for me anyways. "

    w "[[Is what she had told me.]"

    w "You sure? I don't know what magic is like, but doesn't it make you tired?"

    al "Not if I practice!"

    w "[[She pinched me playfully on the cheek and then ran away. I of course just went back to my cleaning.]"

    w "..."

    w "[[On one of those weekends during this period of time I also remember a specific one in which Alyssa had given me a special treat.]"

    w "[[I was outside of the Cartwright Manor throwing away fallen leaves bagged by one of the plebes when Alyssa ran out to me.]"

    al "Wyatt! Come inside! Hurry!"

    w "[[It didn't sound like any kind of emergency, she was much too excited for that. I quickly threw out the bags and made my way calmly to the manor. Alyssa had ran inside without waiting for me so I had to ask someone where she went. Apparently she ran to the dining room.]"

    w "[[I made my way to the dining room almost not believing she was this excited about lunch.]"

    w "[[It was rare to see the entire Cartwright family together for lunch, but when I entered that was exactly what I had seen. Usually dinner was their only family meal.]"

    mrcar "Take a seat Wyatt. We'd be happy if you joined us. "

    w "[[I took a seat next to Alyssa near the end of the table. Mrs Cartwright and Alyssa's four siblings were all in there own conversations. So I figured there was no harm in wispering my curiousity to Alyssa.]"

    w "What's going on? "

    al "The chef made pizza!"

    w "But isn't there rationing because of the war?"

    al "That's why this is a treat. I asked my dad if you can have some since you've never had pizza before. "

    al "My dad wanted it to wait until dinner for it, but my brothers, sister and I couldn't wait. "

    w "I shouldn't impose. "

    al "You work hard; right daddy?"

    mrcar "...Indeed."

    w "[[I was impressed that he could even hear us, but I wouldn't expect any less from the man.]"

    w "[[The pizza was brought to the table by servants, and everyone received two slices.]"

    w "[[It was of course my first time having pizza, so I wasn't exactly sure how to eat it. I watched the family around me before I continued.]"

    w "[[My first bite was heavenly and I let the cheese melt further into my mouth before chewing. As I chewed the contents of the pizza into one mass the taste only intensified.]"

    w "[[Without turning to Alyssa and spoke monotonously with bliss.]"

    w "I see why this is your favorite food. "

    w "[[Alyssa nodded her head and took a large bite from one of her own slices.]"

    w "[[Before most of the Cartwright family had finished I was sure not to take a bite from my second slice.]"

    w "If it's not too much, may I take the second slice to my mom? "

    mrcar "Of course. We will lend you something to carry the slice in. "

    w "Thank you, Master Cartwright."

    mrcar "Also, you can go ahead and leave for the day. "

    w "Thank you, Master Cartwright."

    w "[[I ran home quickly after the lunch. I was excited to give my mom a meal for once.]"

    w "..."

    w "[[I woke up early as usual one weekend. I ate some food that my mom had prepared and I was getting ready to head out. When I opened my front door I was greeted by the angry face of Alyssa Cartwright.]"

    #Uso Da!!

    al "Liar! I asked my dad before he got deployed again and he said there are no tigers in these woods! I knew I shouldn't have doubted myself!"

    w "It's your fault for ever believing me. "

    al "Liar!"

    w "[[She kicked my shin and I hopped while grasping my lower leg. My mom walked out to witness the commotion.]"

    mrscar "A just punishment my Lady, I apologize for any deception my son may have used towards you."

    w "[[I was amazed how quickly Alyssa can go from anger to a genuine smile.]"

    al "No apology needed Rebecca, he's usually a good boy, just not towards me. "

    mrscar "I'm sure he'll warm up to you in time. "

    mrscar "You hear that Wyatt? Work hard today and try not to give Lady Alyssa here any problems. "

    w "Yes mom."

    w "[[I got up from rubbing my shin and I started walking alongside Alyssa to the main household. After sometime we started talking like we normally do.]"

    w "You woke up this early all by yourself? "

    w "[[I tried to sound impressed.]"

    al "Hmph! I had one of the maidservants wake me up. "

    w "Must be nice. "

    al "I don't need you mocking me. Aren't you supposed to be bowing down to me or something?"

    w "I'll do it anytime you ask me to. I don't want to die. "

    narrate "Hahahaha!!"

    w "[[It seemed like it would be great day, but the presence of Alyssa made me forget why I hated these walks.]"

    w "[[There was a shuffle in the bushes to the side of the trail and like clockwork the usual kids that jumped me had blocked my path.]"

    w "[[I turned to look for Alyssa, but she had seemingly disappeared. Perhaps she had ran in fright not knowing that the shuffling was just a bunch of kids that were no real danger to her.]"

    ha "Didn't I tell you to stop using this path Whiney. I walk here on my weekends and I don't need a magicless mutt like you stinking up my scenery. "

    ha "I think he needs another lesson. It seems he is mindless as much as he is magicless."

    ha "Yeah, let's sock him!"

    ha "This won't be the last time, will it Wyatt? Don't worry we'll help educate you, we don't care how long it takes. "

    w "[[I backed myself up into a tree as usual and just waited for the attack, but this time was different from the rest.]"

    w "[[As the three kids approached me I witnessed a ray of light erupt and knock back the kids to there backs. It was then that Alyssa emerged from the forest and confronted the kids that laid on the floor moaning.]"

    al "I don't remember giving you authority to dictate who can walk on my lands, 'Sir' Eric. Or have you even won that title yet? "

    ha "Lady Alyssa!? What are you doing here?"

    w "[[The other two got up quickly and sprinted away from the situation, it looked like this Eric wanted to also, but the conversation he was in shocked him into submission.]"

    al "What are {i}you{/i} doing here Eric!? It just seems to me like you're stinking up my scenery. "

    er "H-he's just a vassal." 

    al "I take good care of my vassals. Now go pick on your own!"

    al "Oh, wait. You don't have any do you!? Weren't you taught that it's rude to abuse someone else's property? Or do I need to {i}educate{/i} you?"

    w "[[Eric bowed before Alyssa as far as his body would let him.]"

    er "M-my Lady, that w-won't be necessary. I learned and I will know from now on."

    al "Get out of my sight!"

    w "[[Finally just like his friends the kid sprinted away into the woods and no sign was seen of him. I still had my back against the tree.]"

    al "That should get them out of your hair. "

    w "..."

    al "What? "

    w "It just means they'll do more subtle things at school and not here. "

    al "They won't get away with jumping you at school, at least the beating up is over with. One thing at a time. "

    w "[[We went alongside each other again and continued the journey to the main household.]"

    w "Hey, Alyssa?"

    al "Yes, Wyatt?"

    w "Where did you learn to yell and say things like that?"

    al "My dad does it all the time to anyone that- ...goes over his head. "

    narrate "[[Suddenly Wyatt was very happy that he had never seen or gotten Master Cartwright angry and vowed he would do his best to never let that happen.]"

    w "[[The rest of the day went on as usual.]"

    w "..."

    w "[[The last war that took place between the Hacketts and the Heidlers went on for four years before the Hito High Council had settled the dispute. It was six months before the end of it when I learned that my father had died.]"

    w "[[That weekend I was excused from my duties at the Cartwright Manor and I was in a tiny corner of the cabin that was my room. I was crying.]"

    w "[[I wasn't sure how it had happened but Alyssa sat on the edge of my little bed as I laid crying.]"

    al "..."

    al "I-...I'm sorry about your father. He was a good man, and a hero to us all. "

    w "Sniff...How do you know?"

    al "What...?"

    w "How do you know...I never got to know my father. I've rarely ever seen him...how do you know he was a good man?"

    al "It's something my father always said, and he knows your dad. "

    w "{i}Knew{/i} him. "

    al "..."

    w "[[I sat up too at the edge of the bed next to Alyssa.]"

    w "I hope you never feel this Alyssa, I hope you never have to feel this pain. That your dad will return when mine couldn't. "

    w "[[I started sobbing again, and Alyssa embraced me as we sat. There were no more words. I simply remember crying to sleep.]"

    w "... "

    w "... ... "

    w "... ... ..."

    w "[[My eyes began to water and before tears fell I stopped writing and took a deep breath. I had not expected myself to get this much writing done, but it was a three hour class.]"

    w "[[I looked at the time on my Asla and realized it was about time to head out I put my pen in my pocket and waited out the last few minutes up until it was time to leave.]"

    w "[[As I got up from my seat and took my bag I turned around one last time to ask Dr Shimazu a question.]"

    w "Will you be reading that? "

    sh "...No reason to. "

    w "[[I grabbed the handle of the door.]"

    sh "Enjoy your day Mr Armstrong."

    w "[[With that final note I departed.]"

    #This scene will make a prelude to the whole feud. Moriya expresses discontent which we discover is his usual attitude and dismisses the entire crew. The player is then left with the options of what to do for the remainder of the lunch period. 

    w "[[Today there was no question to it, I made my way up to the Administration building to eat my lunch. After yesterday it seemed I was considered to be affiliated with Moriya and his gang by all parties.]"

    w "[[The Admin building wasn't far from the Food Court and when I opened the door to walk in I saw the entire crew dining down on the center table, save for Moriya who was looking out the window leaning on the wall.]"

    w "[[I sat down myself and began eating.]"

    wi "Good afternoon, Wyatt. I hear from little Mitsuyo here that you and Moriya went for a walk yesterday. "

    w "That's right. "

    wi "Who was the bugger? Did you get him good? "

    w "[[I shot a quick glance at Mitsuyo, but she didn't acknowledge it.]"

    w "Yeah, I guess you can say we did. "

    y "A Hackett victim, just like when you came around Bill. "

    wi "That's right, it's rather easy to crush a soul with enough force. {i}I{/i} can provide that force with great supply. "

    y "Is that how you get your women too? "

    w "Is everything all right? "

    y "Not sure, he seemed a little irritated when he arrived today. "

    wi "It's not unnatural really. Usually Mitsuyo knows the problem. "

    y "Typical. "

    w "Do {i}you{/i} know the problem. "

    mi "No. Only that he talked to his father today. "

    w "[[It was that same eerie whipser.]"

    w "[[Not to mention her statement held a number of implications behind it. I wasn't normally one to think too deeply on things, but I did wonder what the exact relationship between Moriya and his father was.]"

    w "[[He hadn't shared that topic to specific detail.]"

    w "[[It was silent for a little while. William and Yvonne still tried to poke jabs at one another in a quiet fashion and I had just finished my meal when Moriya spoke again.]"

    m "Everyone, get out!"

    w "[[I hadn't quite received the walk that I was expecting yesterday when Moriya had invited me to go along with him and Mitsuyo, and I was sort of feeling it today.]"

    w "[[I had no qualm with this particular situation and Moriya's apparent irritation. I just did what I should've gotten in the habit of doing, and that was gaining my bearings. As it just so happened to be, Praesentia was rather large.]"

    w "[[I exited the Admin building to the east which happened to be the general location of my next class. I figured I might as well keep close to my next destination in case I lost track of time.]"

    w "[[Eventually I ran across an older looking structure called the Koshiba building. I had not run across it before so I had no guess as to what it might for.]"

    w "[[I did feel a little odd though. Yesterday on the commuter train back home Jodie had told me that I was being kept under surveillance by both the Heidlers and the Hacketts. It was the middle of the day so the Academy wasn't scarce of students.]"

    w "[[Why was I in a panic? Jodie had said that the Hacketts were doing it for the sake of watching Moriya, but she could hardly speak for the Heidlers right?]"

    w "[[Inside the building's lobby there were still a number of people, but I realized immediately that the density of Hitos grew significantly as opposed to outside. So I felt safer, not to mention my next class was a short walk away.]"

    w "[[While she spoke I continued to think back to yesterday and how the Hito Professor that saw us jumping that Hackett did nothing to intervene.]"

    w "[[I had already known, but the system is all fucked up. Who's above who? Who's loyal to who? In the end everyones loyalty was to a specific family, and how the authority worked under that loyalty seemed to be up to how much one was respected.]"

    w "[[Save the Holy Trinity of course, they were always on top.]"

    w "[[I remembered my life with the Cartwrights again, they always treated me well and I served them. I wonder if I would been more rebellious had they treated me progressively worst like Kaori feels the Hitos have been doing to the plebes.]"

    w "Are you saying that it's Moriya's responsibilty to look after the plebes on this continent?"

    w "[[It was true that I had yet to really acquaint myself with the others that seemed to be dragged along with what Moriya does, but Mitsuyo by far is the one I had the most time with.]"

    w "[[Which proved ironic since she was the most quiet of the bunch. I could at the same time use that to some advantage in trying to get information about the distressed Moriya and the general attitude of the group towards the soon-to-be god of the world.]"

    w "[[I matched her pace at first but she proved to quiet a walker, so I just caught up and made my alongside her.]"

    w "Yo, Mitsuyo. "

    mi "..."

    w "What was that all about? "

    mi "He does this quite regularly, you'll become accustomed to it. "

    w "Right, and what exactly is your relationship with Moriya? "

    mi "He's my cousin. "

    w "[[Great another Shimazu. Did all with Hito affiliation drag conversations on in a circular momentum. I didn't have any problems talking to her yeserday. Seems I'd have to put my foot down for this one too.]"
 
    w "Why does everyone pretend to be his friend? "

    mi "..."

    mi "William is sure that if he stays close to my cousin that he may one day rise to a new seat of power either within the Hackett family or even within the Hito clan itself. "

    mi "...Yvonne does it for self-esteem. She sees herself as plain and realizes that her looks and personality are not enough to compete with other Heidler associates. "

    w "And you? "

    mi "I do it for hope. "

    w "Hope? "

    mi "Hope that Moriya will learn to mediate rather than instigate like his fathers before him."

    mi "But you are different, it seems Moriya is trying very hard to keep you within his 'cabinet.' "

    w "It doesn't seem that way to me." 

    mi "Moriya is subtle in all his dealings. "

    w "Still, why would Moriya try to keep me in his circle? "

    mi "..."

    w "Do you know why? "

    mi "...Possibly, but my words are quiet and my secrets are silent. "

    w "[[I wasn't sure I liked that answer for all I know they were involved in some plot to frame me for murder or something.]"

    mi "Do not worry, your well being is not under threat...yet. "

    w "[[That was reassuring.]"

    mi "Are you going to keep following me? "

    w "Until you dismiss me, why? "

    w "[[Mitsuyo motioned behind her to reveal a restroom.]"

    w "Oh...then I'll be seeing you. "

    w "[[She bowed and entered the restroom.]"

    w "[[I left pondering to myself why Moriya would want me to be in his 'cabinet,' but the only thing I figured out is that if he wanted me to stay then it was unlikely I could just leave willingly.]"

    w "[[Well, that shouldn't be too big of a problem. Perhaps in the next few days I could confront William and Yvonne about the subject of Moriya too. That time will come eventually.]"

    w "[[Another thing was on my mind as I headed to my afternoon classes though; Mitsuyo kept up her usual whisper, but it wasn't as eerie as it had previously been. Maybe I was just getting used to talking to her.]"

    wi "He wants to see us all. I think he finally found a way to ease his boredom. "

    w "I thought he was just irritated? "

    wi "Pssh, yeah. Irritated by his boredom. "

    wi "It's been quite some time since he's tried something, you being the exception of course, but since you had nothing to offer I think he plans on something big. "

    w "What do you mean big? "

    wi "But it was only plebes dying really, that and some of Evelyn's programmed conjurations. A few Hacketts got injured though. -Oh, and it set fire to the Science Departments annex building. "

    w "..."

    wi "So it has to be bigger than that."

    w "[[What is wrong with this place? Never mind, anywhere Hacketts and Heidlers meet there is trouble, but I was surprised how much of it was started by the son of the man trying to prevent it.]"

    w "Doesn't the Academy take measures to avoid this stuff? "

    wi "Well, technically speaking Moriya runs academy policy, it was a responsibility given to him by his father. "

    w "Right. "

    w "[[So he could kill everyone here and nothing would be a problem?]"

    w "[[I was going to refuse cooperation, but I saw what Mitsuyo did to that Hackett yesterday. I was literally defenseless in a school full of magic users.]"

    w "[[I wasn't much higher than a plebe either, so if Moriya had no problem killing them, then he'd have no problem killing me.]"

    w "What if I buy some drinks for everyone at a vending machine first? "

    w "[[Moriya had lifted a piece from the board it was the King of white. He pulled a pen out and scribbled a name unto to the side and bottom.]"

    w "[[It read: Christopher Hackett.]"

    wi "Hey-"

    mi "yet. "

    m "One step at a time my good cousin." 

    m "As things are currently running, the plan should be in full motion by tomorrow during lunch I won't have tasks for all of you until then. "

    m "However I will need {i}your{/i} help tonight Mitsuyo. I need to access some private files for the all students attending the academy. So if you could meet me at the usual place tonight that would be great."
