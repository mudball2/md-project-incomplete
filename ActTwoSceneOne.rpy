#Adjusting 

#We'll start off Wyatt in the First class with Dr Shimazu, this does occur right after the letter sequence in the prologue. THis is important because this scene addresses it.

    w "[[Thoughts of Alyssa'a letter came back to me while I remained largely focued on my task. I was still and my eyes closed while I sat at my desk. The task before me was making everything else in the room hover, and it was draining.]"

    w "[[Even with this demanding task though I couldn't help but be brought back to the life outside of it.]"

    w "[[I should probably apologize to Alyssa for taking so long to write her, but I had to make sure I felt completely adjusted to life at Praesentia before I could do it. I didn't want to make her or her family worry.]"

    w "[[I suppose after the whole incident though there really wasn't any way to avoid that.]"

    w "[[She was asking me about girls!? What does she think I'm doing here!?]"

    w "[[Still though, it was great to hear from her.]"

#Door creaks open

#Footsteps?

    w "[[I heard someone enter the room. Based on the sounds it certainly wasn't Dr Shimazu leaving. Considering the doctors age it amazed me he could sit in a room for three hours without having to use the restroom.]"

    w "[[Such a feat is even difficult for me.]"

    w "[[I kept my eyes closed and did my best to continue my task, but I felt myself faltering.]"

    w "[[I couldn't see or hear Dr Shimazu or the newcomer do or say anything, but I could sort of imagine an implied silent conversation that went something like this.]"

    qm "Have a moment?"

    sh "Yes"

    w "[[I couldn't help but smirk at my lackluster attempt at imagining it though.]"

    sh "Mr Armstrong, your attention."

    w "[[I gradually lost focus until all the desks and chairs in the room hit the ground with a somewhat loud racket. The noise caused me to shoot my eyes open.]"

    sh "This is Dr Koshiba, I'm sure you've met him already."

    ko "Very impressive Wyatt! I was unsure how quickly you would pick up your magic knowing you have bad blood, but the results we've been collecting is quite exciting."

    w "Um...thanks."

    ko "Ah, don't feel bad Wyatt, it seems many people have been keeping an eye on you since you've arrived. You're quite popular aren't you? "

    w "..."

    sh "As I've mentioned in a previous class, Dr Koshiba is the lead in research concerning our unique magical affinity. He has come to check your progress today."

    ko "Indeed. Forgive me for not being thorough the first time we met Wyatt, but there was a lot that needed to be done until now. I've brought with me some basic things; may I examine you?"

    w "[[I nodded in response.]"

    ko "Please sit on your desk."

    w "[[He had with him a leather pack that was exactly like the kind used to make housecalls with, I assumed that just meant he was giving me a basic physical.]"

    w "[[I did as I was told and he started pulling things from his leather bag. A sethoscope, a blood pressure cuff, and an otoscope.]"

    w "[[There really wasn't anything too unusual happening. He took my blood pressure and I took my shirt off so he could listen to my heart and lungs. After he was done with that he started asking me questions.]"

    ko "So I'm assume Praesentia has proven quite eventful for you."

    w "[[His otoscope was in my ear when he asked this.]"

    w "Well...it'd be hard to argue that it hasn't."

    w "[[He chuckled]"

    ko "You've found very eventful company to be around, but it's not my place to speak of who you spend your time with. "

    ko "With all the eyes on you I'd say that you've got to be the safest man in this school, so I won't complain. I made a promise afterall."

    ko "Of course my research takes precedence and you are my research. It'd be quite upsetting should anything happen to you."

    w "[[He pointed at my firearm that I had taken off with my shirt.]"

    ko "So be careful with that, and watch yourself."

    w "I'll try."

    ko "I'm going to take some blood and then I'll be off."

    w "[[I nodded.]"

    w "... "

    w "... ..."

    w "... ... ..."

    w "[[Before I knew it lunch had come. It seemed that lately my class with Dr Shimazu had gotten a lot shorter from when I first started attending Praesentia, and quite surprisingly that seemed so long ago.]"

    w "[[I wasn't very fond of visiting the Food Court these days. Ever since the night of the incidient your hair would stick up from all the lightning in the air. It was quite troubling really, especially when you were packed with so many others.]"

    w "[[Following my usual routine since that night I just grabbed my food and left to the isolation of the Main Library to eat before walking to the clubroom.]"

    w "[[As I entered the library and made my way to the usual study table I ate at I was greeted by an acquaintance of mine, or I suppose you could call him a friend even.]"

    jo "Pizza again, Wyatt? "

    w "[[I had grown rather attached to the meal, even more so after discovering that hot sauce makes it even better.]"

    w "You know it. "

    w "[[I didn't hesitate to sit down and take a bite right away. I spoke with my mouth full.]"

    w "How were classes. "

    jo "More Asla training. It seems wards are little harder to contend with than the usual energy it's meant to produce. "

    jo "You'd think it'd be easy, but molding the raw energy to the desired shape is a lot harder than it seems. "

    jo "Then there's timing, it would appear that raw energy does not like to be controlled."

    w "I wouldn't imagine."

    jo "You? "

    w "I had a visit today from a certain Dr Koshiba."

    jo "Important man. Why? "

    w "He just gave me a physical exam."

    jo "Interesting. What're you sick or something? "

    w "No. He apparently researches my magical affinity is all."

    jo "You seem to be notorious for attracting a lot of important people then. "

    w "We've already talked about this. "

    jo "I know, I'm just saying."

    jo "Still going to the clubroom today? "

    w "...I feel like I'm expected to at least every other day."

    jo "Understandable, His Holiness is certainly not someone on my list to upset. "

    w "..."

    jo "You alright? "

    w "Yeah."

    w "[[We haven't known each other long, but somehow the conversation always seems to go to Moriya one way or another. I sort of hoped he'd be more of an escape from him by now.]"

    w "[[In due time maybe. I found something else for us to talk about and we finished our lunch.]"

    w "[[After exiting the library together we encountered a Hackett approaching a Heidler.]"

#I need some sort of good insult for Heidlers, either that or I'll just stick to the normal stuff.

    ha "Fuck off, pest! No Heidlers allowed!"

#Gee, I don't know....Pest?

    he "That right!? I don't remember having to listen to assholes like you. "

    w "[[Joshua and I just sort of watched the two become increasingly more hostile to one another before Joshua decided to step in too.]"

    w "[[Except Joshua didn't do any talking he just ran up and punched the Heidler in his face.]"

    w "Shit. "

#Loud couple of Pops

    w "[[Two bright lights exploded between the three belligerents knocking them onto the ground.]"

    w "[[As they all laid flat a blue energy field wrapped around them and held them in stasis. The source of these phenomena came from a group of Student Council Disciplinary Committee members.]"

    w "[[I didn't want to get involved unless I needed to, so I stayed my distance.]"

    w "[[They let the Heidler go first clearly telling him to leave the area obviously aware that he was the source of the problem and then let Joshua and the other Hackett go after the Heidler was some distance away.]"

    w "[[Joshua approached me.]"

    jo "Thanks for the help."

    w "No problem. "

    w "[[He laughed a little from my response to his sarcasm.]"

    jo "It's been happening more frequently lately. I wonder who'll be the first to snap when the SCDC isn't around. "

    w "I don't know."

    w "..."

    jo "Well then. I'll see you later, Wyatt."

    w "See ya."

    w "..."

    w "... ... "

    w "... ... ..."

    w "[[I was outside the clubroom trying to hear anything on the other side to see if anyone was in. It wasn't surprising that I couldn't actually hear anything though. I walked in.]"

    w "...Hello?"

    w "[[Mitsuyo looked at me silently, she had chopsticks in her hand and a half finished meal sitting in front of her.]"

    w "[[Not much had changed in the clubroom over the past couple weeks, but it was nice to see Mitsuyo. I was sure this was the first time I was seeing her since the incident. Of course that couldn't be right either.]"

    w "Only you Mitsuyo?"

    w "[[I got a nod from Mitsuyo even though it was obvious that was the case.]"

    w "[Figuring I may not get a good conversation from her I decided to make some coffee using the machine inside the clubroom, it sat to the far left of the room on another table.]"

    w "[[After getting the coffee machine going I noticed a deck of cards sitting on the table next to it. I grabbed them curiously wondering if it was indeed a full deck and just assumed that was the case.]"

    w "[[I placed them in my pocket and poured a mug of coffee for Mitsuyo and me.]"

    w "Here you go."

    w "[[I realized that Mitsuyo probably preferred tea, but she accepted my offer anyways.]"

    mi "Thank you."

    w "[[As usual she was quiet.]"

    w "[[I sat down across from her and sipped on my coffee while staring at space.]"

    w "..."

    mi "..."

    w "[[I suppose it was one of those days that I could've not come to the clubroom. It didn't hurt to burn some time though, it was quite some time before my next class.]"

    w "[[The chestboard that Moriya placed a couple weeks ago was still here with two pawns missing from it. I wonder if this was going to stay until Moriya moved it.]"

    w "[[When Mitsuyo finished her meal I pulled out the deck of cards from my pocket.]"

    w "Want to play a game?"

    mi "...I don't know any."

    w "I'll teach you then. Ever heard of speed? "

    w "[[Mitsuyo shook her head. It was apparent she had never played with a deck of cards, but I had at least expected her to have heard of some of the games.]"

    w "[[I guess I didn't mind teaching her either though.]"

#Maybe you could put a little speed mini game here?

    w "[[She picked it up rather quickly, I suppose one doesn't just become the Student Council President.]"

    w "[[Although she is quiet, I wonder how that worked for her?]"

    w "[[Then I rembered her booming whisper the day after the incident when she was addressing the entire student body. An enormous student body at that.]"

    w "[[I was setting up for another game...]"

    m "What are you guys doing? "

    w "[[My heart still skipped a beat when he did that.]"

    m "Playing a game of cards? That's odd, I thought you weren't the type to play games Mitsuyo? "

    mi "Hmpf-"

    w "You should've said so then. "

    w "[[Moriya grabbed my coffee mug and drank what was left of it.]"

    m "I forget you like your coffee bitter."

    m "Was that an acquired taste, or has it always been like that? "

    w "Acquired."

    w "[[I started packing up the cards.]"

    w "I started liking it that way sometime in high school I think. Before then that wasn't the case. "

    w "[[Come to think of it I don't think I really enjoy sweets as much as I use to either. Was I getting old?]"

    m "It's funny how that works. "

    m "I hate to ask you to leave, but Mitsuyo and I need to talk. "

    w "Nah, it's no problem. Time's flown anyways, I need to get to my next class."

    w "[[I left the cards on the table and made my way to the exit. As I closed the door behind me I noticed that Moriya was moving a white pawn on the chestboard.]"

    w "[[All of a sudden I didn't really want to know what they were going to talk about.]"

    w "..."

    w "... ..."

    w "... ... ..."

    w "[[Depending on which day of the block schedule it was in the afternoon classes would either be really quick or really slow.]"

    w "[[Today the classes scheduled were more physical and therefore made the day seem a lot quicker.] "

    w "[[After classes I went to the far west of the campus by the Aerospace Department to complete some homework that was assigned to me. The sky was consumed by a orange hue as test pilots took off with what I assumed were aricraft made by the students of the Aerospace field.]"

    w "[[It was an interesting sight and the spectacle somehow didn't distract me too much from my homework. Before all the light from twilight had vanished I was done and I received an email from Joshua.]"

    jo "\'Meet me at the Underground, my treat!\'"

    w "[[Well the weekend had come pretty quick, and I had no reason to refuse so I started making my way to the Undergound to meet Joshua like I was asked.]"

    w "..."

    w "[[After using the restroom at one of the nearby buildings on my way to meet Joshua I ran into another familiar face in the hallway.]"

    k "!!!"

    w "[[Her face was like she had seen a ghost when I walked out. There was cart behind her as well.]"

    w "[[Seems she had the intention of going in to clean the restroom until I walked out.]"

    w "Kaori?"

#Nervous look from Kaori?

    k "M-master Wyatt? "

    k "I h-hope your day has been going well."

    w "[[I recall the last time we were together Dr Shimazu had walked in on us after I fell on top of her.]"

#Continuity check!!! Was this the last scene they were like this? Available on all options?

    w "Look, about last time..."

    #More surpised Kaori with blush, because that's how anime do it!!

    k "M-ma-ma-maaster I- I'm- It was unintentional, S-sorry!"

    w "I know it was Kaori, it was my fault so I'm apologizing."

    k "Th-that's ridiculous. I brought you down. "

    k "*gasp*"

#Those gasping mice are right!

    k "Oh, but I'm not saying your wrong either master-"

    w "[[Perhaps apologizing was a bad idea after all.]"

    w "[[She began to run straight into the restroom presumably to start her cleaning, but I grabbed her by both shoulders and looked her in the eye.]"

    w "Look, I'm sorry. Just accept that how it is."

    w "[[She looked at me blushing. Although she looked more terrified than understanding.]"

    w "[[She eventually did close her eyes and gave me a curt nod as if to accept the words I was saying so I let her go with a sigh.]"

    w "There, I said it."

    w "[[I was sure that was an accomplishment.]"

    k "I'msorrymasterWyattIdidn'tmeantto!!"

    w "[[Kaori ran into the bathroom with her cart.]"

    w "[[Perhaps I hadn't accomplished anything.]"

    w "*sigh*"

    w "[[Girls?]"

    w "[[Perhaps Alyssa was onto something.]"

    w "[[Although I didn't want to tell her that my entire social life with girls was with an anxious plebe and an uncommunicative Hito.]"

    w "[[I still had to reply to her.]"

    w "[[I still had to meet Joshua too. I continued my way to the Underground, I didn't want to keep him waiting too long.]"

#There AJ, I gave them something to talk about.

    w "..."

    w "... ..."

    w "... ... ..."

#My original intention was to include another scene in the arcade section of the Underground, but I figured more questions would arise as to whether or not a minigame should be included. #Although I do not think that it is outside the limits of the programmer to do so, but it would also bring about the question of design which would likely lead to more money out of our #pockets. So instead Wyatt and his friend Joshua go to one of the bars and discuss the recent mood that has been accumulating there as of late. I may include an appearance of Ayna with either #ukas or Niklas, but I am unsure as of writing this. 

#Regarding the subject of a minigame: pool might be a good idea.

    jo "To another welcomed weekend!"

    w "Cheers!"

    w "[[We both took a few gulps of our drinks.]"

    w "It's a shame they're so short though. "

    jo "It just makes them that much more appreciated! "

    jo " Get a real drink, we're celebrating!"

    w "Celebrating what? "

    jo "I forgot I had a test today, but I'm feeling pretty good after taking it so it means I know more than I had thought. "

    w "It could always be one of those tests that you feel good about and them end up failing. "

    jo "One step at a time Wyatt."

    w "[[Joshua waved his had dismissively while saying that.]"

    jo "You should get a drink though. This isn't the Western continent, here in Hito land the drinking age is much lower."

    w "I don't want to spend tomorrow with a headache though. "

    jo "One or two won't hurt you. "

    w "[[I just laughed nervously while pondering whether or not to take the offer. While doing so I took a look around this part of the underground.]"

    w "It's been becoming increasingly more sparse of people."

#Serious face from Joshua

    jo "Yeah, it has. With all the fights breaking out I imagine people are just trying to avoid them."

    jo "Still, at least it isn't completely empty. "

    jo "Maybe one of these girls here can cover for that Alyssa of yours while you're here."

    w "I told you it wasn't like that."

    jo "I know, and it's depressing. Why would you skip out on a redhead?"

    jo "Look; that girl over there looks like a good time. You should go talk to her. "

    w "I would, I could, but I won't."

    w "[[We both laughed. I knew Joshua wasn't really trying to hook me up with anyone. He was just teasing me because he could.]"

    w "[[Looking at the entrance as a new party walked in, the previously Hackett filled bar was suddenly quiet.]"

    w "[No one spoke louder than a hushed whisper.]"

#I suppose Anya does make an appearance. 

    jo "Well...if it isn't the big bitch herself."

    jo "She's the one?"

    w "According to Moriya, yes."

    jo "I wonder how she's gotten away with defying his Holiness this long?"

#It would appear that Anya has yet to say any lines. I guess she's just visible to the player in some way.

    w "I don't think he really cares about it, just interested on whether she'd do it or not."

    jo "You're probably right. All he'd have to do is make her really."

    w "[[Noticably many of the Hacketts that had settled in the bar before us had gotten up to start leaving, probably going to visit a more lively club in the Underground.]"

    w "We should probably leave too. "

    jo "Yeah, hold on. "

    w "[[Joshua left the table to go to one of the plebes working the bar and then came back.]"

    jo "Quick, let's go. "

    w "[[As we began to leave the plebe gave Anya a drink, a martini of some sort. After a few word from the plebe she picked up the glass and poured it on the floor before dropping it with an audible shatter.]"

    w "[[Joshua appeared to be laughing at the scene, clearly not making the feuding matters any better.]"

    w "[[As we left a few more Heidlers were making their way in.]"

    w "..."

    jo "What? "

    jo "She went in there to try ruining all of our nights. I simply returned the favor. "

    w "*sigh*" 

    w "[[After another hour with Josh at the Underground I made my way back to my dorm.]"

    w "..."

    w "... ..."

    w "... ... ..."

    w "[[By the time I was walking to my dorm room door I was already tired. It didn't make much sense since it was obviously not too late in the night, but I had never been one to stay up late.]"

    w "[[My Asla identified me to the door and I walked in and took off my coat immediately. Tomorrow I wouldn't have to be in uniform, that was in some way a relief. I use to think uniforms were a cool idea but that's hardly the case now.]"

    w "[[I didn't bother taking off my uniform, I just landed back first onto my bed and took a deep breath.]"

    w "[[Some time had passed, and I wasn't actually sure if I had fallen asleep for the amount of time, I was only sure that a loud crash jolted me up.]"

    w "[[It came from the hallway.]"

    w "[[Looking at my clock it showed a little pass midnight. It wasn't usually the time of night you'd be hearing a ruckus outside my dorm.]"

    w "[[I debated checking in on it.]"
